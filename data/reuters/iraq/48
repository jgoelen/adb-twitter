SYDNEY Aug 19 (Reuters) - Iraq, one the world's largest
wheat importers, is expected to issue a tender for at least
100,000 tonnes of wheat for shipment in November and December,
two trade sources said.

 The tender could be issued by Sunday with countries such as
Australia and the United States likely to bid for the business,
one source said. A second trade source said Iraq could issue a tender in 7
days after a Russian supplier is believed to have defaulted on
a shipment. (Reporting by Bruce Hextall Sydney and Karl Plume in
