BAGHDAD Aug 17 (Reuters) - At least 18 Iraqi army recruits
and soldiers were killed and 51 wounded on Tuesday when a
suicide bomber blew himself up among them outside a recruitment
centre in Baghdad, a deputy health minister said.

 One police source said the death toll could be as high as
43, with 106 wounded, making it potentially one of the bloodiest
attacks in recent weeks. Political tensions are simmering in Iraq after an
inconclusive election more than five months ago and before the
end of U.S. combat operations this month.
