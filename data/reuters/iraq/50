WASHINGTON Aug 18 (Reuters) - A senior Obama
administration official said on Wednesday the U.S. troop
drawdown in Iraq was currently at 56,000, not 50,000, as he
told Reuters earlier.

 "I had incorrect information," the official said. The Obama administration has said it expects to draw down
troop levels to 50,000 by Aug. 31.
