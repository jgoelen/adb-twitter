BAGHDAD Aug 17 (Reuters) - The death toll in a suicide bombing at an Iraqi army recruiting centre in the Iraqi capital Baghdad rose to 39 on Tuesday, the Baghdad operations command said. Fifty-seven were wounded, the command said in a statement. The attack occurred at the site of what used to be the Defence Ministry under Saddam Hussein, turned into an army recruitment centre and military base after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.
