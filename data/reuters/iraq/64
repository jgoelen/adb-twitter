HOUSTON & DUBAI, United Arab Emirates--(Business Wire)--
Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) has been awarded a letter of intent by Shell Iraq
Petroleum Development B.V. for the development of the Majnoon field in Southern
Iraq. 

The giant Majnoon field is one of the world`s largest oilfields. The letter of
intent provides that Halliburton will serve as project manager for the
development work, in affiliation with Nabors Drilling and Iraq Drilling Company
(IDC). The contract is still subject to final approval by the appropriate Iraqi
authorities. 

Shell is lead operator and holds a 45 percent share, partner Petroliam Nasional
Berhad (Petronas) holds 30 percent and the Iraqi state holds 25 percent of the
participating interests in all licenses. Shell has announced that the consortium
intends to increase production from the current ~45,000 barrels of oil per day
to a targeted production plateau of 1.8 million barrels of oil per day. 

"Halliburton has made a sizeable investment in Iraq and we look forward to
providing services to Shell and the consortium in order to increase production
at this historic oil field," said Dave Lesar, Halliburton`s Chairman, President
and CEO. "We have in place the technology, equipment and personnel to ensure
that we deliver the solutions that will help our customers in this region to
meet their production goals." 

Halliburton has been active in the Middle East since 1946. Currently,
Halliburton has more than 4,000 employees in the Middle East, and construction
on phase I of Halliburton`s 400-man base in Burjisia, Iraq is complete.
