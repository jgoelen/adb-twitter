				SOUNDBITES:  Soundbite #1) Ambassador Christopher HillSummary: Amb. Hill says that Iraqi forces are currently planning and executing operations against the Al Qaida far better than a year and a half ago.Ambassador Hill IN: "What can be done against them is being done against them and so do I think the problem is getting worse. No I think actually it's getting better and I think that it's a testimony to a couple of things. One being what our forces have done and two what the Iraqi forces are doing. A number of the ops, the operations against these Al Qaida are planned and executed by Iraqi forces in a way that was unimaginable just a year and a half ago. So I think that a lot's being done but what's frustrating to all of us is wake up in the morning and hear about some bomb blast killing scores of people and I think understandably everyone wants to know when this is going to end and I think that's what difficult to predict." (RT-:43).Soundbite #2) Ambassador Christopher HillSummary: Ambassador Hill feels the U.S. Iraq relationship is growing into what the Iraqi people want: a long-term sustained relationship.Ambassador Hill IN: "I think the U.S. relationship with Iraq is in a position I think to grow and to be self-sustaining and to be long-term and that's what we sought. We didn't want a situation where we'd be considered an occupier and therefore as soon as you leave we'd go back to what we want to do. I think the Iraqis very much want to have that long term relationship." (RT-:28)Soundbite #3) Ambassador Christopher HillSummary: Ambassador Hill said the U.S.-Iraq strategy is the right one and the government will eventually be formed by the Iraqis themselves.Ambassador Hill: IN: "We have the right strategy in Iraq; it's clearly going in the right direction. I would have been much happier today if there was a new government formed, I'd be much happier once again arguing with each other in the council of representatives. But that day will come."
