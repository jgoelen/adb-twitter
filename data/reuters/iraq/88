BAGHDAD Aug 17 (Reuters) - The toll from a suicide bombing
at an Iraqi army recruitment centre on Tuesday rose to 47 killed
and 77 wounded, a deputy health minister said.

 The toll was not expected to increase, said Deputy Health
Minister Khamis al-Saad. It was one of the bloodiest attacks in weeks, underscoring a
spreading sense of gloom more than five months after an
inconclusive election that has yet to produce a new government
and ahead of the end of U.S. combat operations this month.
