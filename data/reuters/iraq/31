ISTANBUL Aug 20 (Reuters) - Turkish lender Vakifbank
(VAKBN.IS) expects to post the same level of year-end profit as
it did last year, said General Manager Suleyman Kalkan, after
the bank showed a 22 percent fall in second-quarter net profit.

 The bank's loan growth is performing along with the sector
average, Kalkan told reporters late on Thursday. The bank is
looking to expand in home loans, where it is already among the
market leaders. Kalkan also said he thought the bank would open a branch in
the city of Arbil in northern Iraq by the end of the year.
