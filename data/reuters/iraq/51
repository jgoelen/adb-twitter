WASHINGTON Aug 18 (Reuters) - The United States has
completed its drawdown of its forces to Iraq to 50,000, ahead
of the scheduled Aug. 31 date, a senior administration official
said on Wednesday.

 He added the combat mission was not yet over and would
continue until Aug. 31. "We have drawn down to 50,000, but to be clear, the mission
changes on the 31st, when brigades that are left are
re-missioned to advise-and-assist brigades," a senior Obama
administration said.
