Aug 19 (Reuters) - The United States is on track to draw
down its forces in Iraq to 50,000 by Aug. 31, but there are
doubts President Barack Obama can fulfil his pledge to withdraw
all U.S. troops by the end of 2011.

 President George W. Bush launched the U.S.-led invasion in
2003 that ousted Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. But the war
became unpopular among Americans as U.S. deaths mounted. As of Aug. 18, the Defense Department said there were 4,419
U.S. military deaths since the 2003 invasion.
Following is a list of other wars, how long the United
States was involved in each and the number of U.S. military
fatalities:
