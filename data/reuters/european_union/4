<content>null   LONDON | Wed Nov 30, 2011 1:10am EST   LONDON Nov 30 (Reuters) - European shares are set to snap a three-session winning streak on Wednesday, with financial stocks seen coming under pressure following Standard & Poor&apos;s move to cut its credit ratings on 15 big banks, mostly in Europe and the United States.  Barclays, HSBC Holdings, UBS, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America, Citigroup , Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group and Morgan Stanley were among the banks that had their ratings reduced by one notch each. Financial spreadbetters predicted Britain&apos;s FTSE 100 to open 44 to 49 points lower, or as much as 0.9 percent, Germany&apos;s DAX to fall around 35 points, or 0.6 percent, and France&apos;s CAC-40 to open 26 to 27 points lower, or about 0.9 percent.</content>
