<content>null   Wed Nov 30, 2011 2:41am EST   LONDON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - European shares are set to snap a three-session winning streak on Wednesday, with financial stocks seen coming under pressure following Standard & Poor&apos;s overnight move to cut its credit ratings on several big European and U.S. banks. Barclays, HSBC, UBS, JPMorgan Chase & Co , Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were among the banks that had their ratings reduced by one notch each as the result of a sweeping overhaul of S&P&apos;s ratings criteria. The move could increase funding costs for some banks. &quot;Yesterday&apos;s downgrades by S&P on a number of banks in both Europe and the U.S. has rocked sentiment in equity markets,&quot; Terry Pratt, trader at IG Markets, said. &quot;This move has essentially overshadowed the progress that had been made in Brussels with regard to leveraging the EFSF bailout fund.&quot; Euro zone finance ministers met in Brussels on Tuesday to agree on leveraging their bailout fund so it can help Italy or Spain should they need aid. The ministers, who may turn to the International Monetary Fund for more help, also agreed to release the next aid payments to Greece and Ireland. The ministers agreed on a detailed plan to insure the first 20-30 percent of new bond issues for countries having funding difficulties and to create co-investment funds to attract foreign investors to buy euro zone government bonds.
