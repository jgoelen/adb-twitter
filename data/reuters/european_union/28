<content>null   Wed Nov 30, 2011 2:30am EST   (Oslo, Norway 30th of November 2011) The work to combat digital bullying is attracting international attention. Today, experts from the UK and Spain are visiting Holmlia school in Oslo to see how Norway&apos;s biggest school campaign is working to raise awareness of the use of digital media by children and adolescents. &quot;This shows that what we are doing is working. If we can act as a model for similar work to our European collaboration partners, it is proof that we are using the right methods, which could also benefit young people in other countries,&quot; says Stian Lindbøl, Manager of the Norwegian Media Authority&apos;s &quot;Trygg bruk&quot; (safe usage ) centre.  The experts from the UK and Spain are part of the &quot;Trygg bruk&quot; centre&apos;s European network. Around 30 countries across Europe are taking part in the EU&apos;s Safer Internet Plus Programme and all are working towards a common goal of strengthening and protecting children and adolescents on the Internet. Each country has its own &quot;Safer Internet Centre&quot;. In Norway, the responsibility for this centre has been delegated to the Norwegian Media Authority.&quot;It is encouraging that experts from other countries want to learn about how we are working on digital bullying in Norway through the &quot;Bruk Hue&quot; (&quot;Use your head&quot;) campaign. Today, we are rounding off our fifth season of Bruk Hue at Holmlia, and this type of attention is seen as confirmation that what we are doing is right and a source of inspiration for the further work in 2012,&quot; says Torild Lid Uribarri, Director of Communication and Corporate Social Responsibility at Telenor Norway.Good resultsSince 2009, Telenor Norway, the Norwegian Media Authority, the Red Cross and Barnevakten have been working together to combat digital bullying through the Bruk Hue school campaign. This campaign gives both children and adults information on preventing and combating digital bullying and is producing good results. A survey conducted by Norstat on behalf of Telenor shows that three out of every four pupils who have participated in Bruk Hue&apos;s awareness campaign have found out what they needed to know in order to avoid bullying via mobile phone and the Internet.End of season marked by Oslo rappers Emire and LillebrorNow that the autumn season 2011 is drawing to a close, the Norwegian Media Authority&apos;s British and Spanish colleagues have expressed a particular interest in the Bruk Hue campaign. The same goes for the artists Emire and Lillebror (Little Brother), who will give a mini-concert to mark the occasion. &quot;When thousands of young people in Norway are bullied by mobile phone and the Internet every day, it&apos;s good to know that prevention works. We&apos;re glad to turn up for such an important issue, and we reckon the mood will be great at Holmlia today,&quot; says Assad Arif, alias Lillebror.So far, the campaign has visited 250 lower secondary schools and met around 70,000 young people and 12,500 parents.
