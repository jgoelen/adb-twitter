 (Recasts with analysts comment, adds background) By Erika Solomon and Kiyoshi Takenaka DUBAI/TOKYO, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Militants attacked a Japanese
supertanker with explosives near the Strait of Hormuz, one of
the world's most important shipping routes, the United Arab
Emirates state news agency said on Friday. The crew of the 333-metre-long M.Star reported an explosion
shortly after midnight on July 28, injuring one seaman though
causing no oil spill or disruption to shipping in the strategic
waterway, bordered by Iran, Oman, and the UAE. "An examination carried out by specialised teams has
confirmed that the tanker has been the subject of a terrorist
attack," state news agency WAM said, quoting an unidentified
coastguard source. "UAE explosives experts who collected and examined samples
found a dent on the starboard side above the water line and
remains of home-made explosives on the hull," the source said. &lt;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Map showing incident site: r.reuters.com/nuh33n Factbox on Abdullah Azzam Brigade: [ID:nLDE6751GH] Q+A on possible causes: [ID:nLDE6731OU] ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&gt; Two days ago, a militant group calling itself the Abdullah
Azzam Brigades, which is linked to al Qaeda, claimed
responsibility for the incident. [ID:nLDE673047] Security analysts based in the Gulf, some previously
sceptical of suggestions the ship was attacked, said they
believed the state news agency report. "The UAE has no interest in portraying this as a terrorist
attack," said Theodore Karasik, a security analyst of
Dubai-based INEGMA. "So saying that it is, that's significant." The M.Star incident has provoked several theories about the
cause, ranging from a freak wave to a collision with a U.S.
nuclear submarine.
 The ship's hull was damaged on the starboard side, and a
lifeboat was blown off the deck and windows and doors were
smashed. 
 OWNERS AWAIT DETAILS A spokeswoman for shipowner Mitsui O.S.K. (9104.T) said the
company could not confirm details of the WAM report.  "The investigation on the tanker is still continuing, and
while we are looking at all possibilities, the company has not
heard anything that will help determine the cause of the
damage," she said. The company's president, Koichi Muto, said he did not rule
out the possibility of an attack, according to the Nikkei
business daily.  Oil prices were not affected and there were no indications
of shipping being more carefully patrolled in the Strait of
Hormuz, oil traders said. "No shipowners are panicking," a trader, who asked not to be
named, said. However, analysts said if a strike were confirmed, security
for shipping would have to be increased. [ID:nLDE67519C] "If the attack on the M.Star is not a one-time event, but
others follow, it does place additional stress on both the
shipping industry and the navies of the world," said J.Peter
Pham, a strategic adviser to U.S. and European governments. The narrow Strait of Hormuz handles 40 percent of the
world's seaborne oil and is patrolled by U.S. and other
warships. Karasik said while there were no signs of it yet, the
incident may lead to changes in naval patrols in the region. "You'll see more warships patrolling in, around, and outside
of the Strait," he said. Industry sources said the tanker carried more than 2 million
barrels of Qatar Land and Abu Dhabi Lower Zakum crudes,
equivalent to about half of Japan's daily oil needs.  Carsten Fritsch, an analyst with Commerzbank in Frankfurt,
said the oil trade would not be affected by the attack because
high inventories and spare OPEC capacity. 
 JAPAN SEEKING SAMPLES A spokesman for the U.S. Fifth Fleet, part of an
international coalition of navies that patrol Gulf waters, said
U.S. Navy divers had taken part in examining the ship. "Our experts will be in contact with UAE officials about
their findings and the Fifth Fleet will continue to assist the
Mitsui investigation," he said. "Our coalition and regional partners have maintained
constant vigilance in the area and we will continue to do so." The UAE report said the M.Star had left local waters to
resume its voyage to Japan, which trade sources confirmed. A Japanese Transport Ministry official said that samples
from the tanker, including some taken from the dent, were on
their way to Japan to help pinpoint the cause of the damage. "We've asked for any remains that could help us identify the
cause. Some kind of soot may be among them. Something melted
could be among them," the official said. Mustafa Alani of the Gulf Research Centre said while details
were still vague, it appeared that inexperienced militants had
made a "very amateur attempt" at mimicking the 2000 suicide bomb
attack on the U.S. warship Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden,
where a boat rigged with explosives killed 17 U.S. sailors. The French-flagged oil tanker Limburg was attacked off Yemen
using a bomb-laden dinghy in 2002, killing one crew member. Al
Qaeda-linked militants linked to both attacks escaped from jail
near the Yemeni city of Sanaa in 2006.
