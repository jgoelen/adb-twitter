 * FTSE  down 1.2 percent; Fed move fails to boost confidence

 * Energy, miners slide, commodity prices weaken on outlook * Bank of England inflation data eyed 
 By David Brett LONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Britain's top shares fell early
on Wednesday, with banks and commodity-linked stocks leading a
broad-based retreat after measures by the U.S. Federal Reserve
to bolster its economy failed to provide much reassurance. By 0745 GMT, the FTSE 100 .FTSE index was down 63.23
points, or 1.2 percent at 5,313.18, having shed 0.6 percent to
5,376.41 on Tuesday. London's blue chips tracked overnight losses on Wall Street
and in Asia after the Fed's Open Market Committee said it would
use proceeds from maturing mortgage bonds to buy longer-term
government debt to keep borrowing costs low. [ID:nN09275781] The move, a stark warning that the recovery of the world's
largest economy was losing pace, failed to convince investors
the action would swiftly resolve a weak employment market or
boost demand significantly. "We were expecting major quantitative easing (QE) and what
we got was QE light," said James Hughes, market analyst at CMC
Markets. Energy and mining companies were the worst-performing
sectors on the FTSE 100, falling along with crude CLc1 and
metal prices respectively as the outlook for demand darkened. Intergrated oils BP (BP.L), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and
BG Group (BG.L) shed 0.6-1.5 percent. An approaching storm in the Gulf of Mexico will delay BP's
work on a relief well by two to three days, a U.S. official said
on Tuesday. The move is the final step in permanently killing
the source of the world's worst offshore oil spill.
[ID:nN10152215] Miners Xstrata (XTA.L), down 2.3 percent, and Rio Tinto
(RIO.L), off 2.2 percent, were the top fallers in the sector. Barclays (BARC.L), BT Group (BT.L), Rio Tinto (RIO.L)  RSA
Insurance (RSA.L), Schroders (SDR.L), Standard Chartered
(STAN.L), and Unilever (ULVR.L) all went ex-dividend, knocking a
total of 6.10 points off the index. 
 BANKS RETREAT Banks also fell as investors awaited the Bank of England's
quarterly inflation report at 0930 GMT, with Lloyds Banking
Group (LLOY.L) down 1.7 percent and Barclays 4.1 percent lower,
also as it traded without dividend attractions. The BoE was expected to suggest more subdued growth over the
next two years than in its May report, due to spending cuts
announced by the new government in its June budget. The inflation forecasts, however, could be significantly
higher to take account of a rise in value added tax from 2011
and a recent surge in wheat prices. "We are expecting the Bank of England to move their
expectations for growth," said CMC's Hughes, although he does
not believe the bank will boost its own QE programme just yet. Casting further doubt over the recovery in Britain, consumer
morale in Tuesday fell to its lowest since May 2009 as
households took a  bleaker view of the outlook following June's
austere budget, building society Nationwide said.
[ID:nSLAAJE6A3] Investors will watch for employment data, due at 0830 GMT. Of the few gainers, British drinks group Diageo (DGE.L) was
a standout performer after Barclays Capital raised its rating to
"equalweight" from "underperform".
