 LONDON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE is seen opening flat
to 4 points up on Monday, as firmer commodity prices are set to offset weakness
in Asia on disappointing Japanese growth data and after a lower close on Friday
on Wall Street.

 Asian shares were mostly lower, pressured as Japan's economy grew at just
0.1 percent, much less than the 0.6 percent forecast.

 But they had recovered some ground by the end of trade as risk appetite
recovered slightly and metal and crude prices CLc1 inched higher on the day.
This will likely be supportive of heavyweight miners and energy stocks on the
British blue-chip index.

 Japan' Nikkei 225 .N225 was 0.8 percent weaker while U.S. stocks posted
their fourth day of losses on Friday as firm retail sales data did little to
shake the overall impression that the economy is facing stiff headwinds.

 Asking prices for homes in England and Wales fell by 1.7 percent in August
after an oversupply of property coincided with a seasonal dip in demand,
property website Rightmove said on Monday. 

 Prices fell by their biggest margin since a 2.2 percent decline recorded in
December, another period when the holiday season depresses prices.

 UK stocks to watch on Monday are: 

 


 RSA (RSA.L), AVIVA (AV.L)

 RSA has secured backing from three major banks for at least 5 billion pounds
($7.8 billion) in equity if the British insurer can pursue its bid for Aviva's
non-life unit in the UK, Canada and Ireland, the Financial Times said on
Monday.

 One investor in Aviva, which recently rejected a 5 billion pound ($7.81
billion) bid for its general insurance unit from RSA (RSA.L), told Reuters there
were potential synergies in a deal of that nature. [ID:nLDE67E05Y]
