BIRMINGHAM Ala., Aug 13 (Reuters) - Alabama is suing BP Plc (BP.L) (BP.N) and Transocean (RIG.N) for damages sustained from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the state's attorney general said on Friday. &quot;We are making this claim because we believe that BP has inflicted catastrophic harm on the state,&quot; attorney general Troy King told Reuters. &quot;We are suing them for the amount it will take to make Alabama whole,&quot; he said, declining to name a figure.
