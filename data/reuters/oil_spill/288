    The primary focus of the EPA and Unified Command is on clean-up at the
main leak site and along the shorelines of the Talmadge Creek and
Kalamazoo River.

    Enbridge has launched a website to provide updates and further
information about the Company's response to the leak on the 6B pipeline
near Marshall, Michigan. The URL for the website is
response.enbridgeus.com.

    On Monday, July 26, a 30-inch pipeline belonging to Enbridge Energy
Partners LP burst in Marshall, Mich., releasing an estimated 819,000
gallons of crude oil into Talmadge Creek, a waterway that feeds the
Kalamazoo River. The spill has affected up to 25 miles of the Kalamazoo
River. The spill site, located between Marshall and Battle Creek,
includes marshlands, residential areas, farmland and businesses.
