 * Unions complained after vapor leak in July
 (Adds company response)RIO DE JANEIRO Aug 12 (Reuters) - Brazil's oil regulator
said on Thursday it halted operations of state oil company
Petrobras' (PETR4.SA) offshore P-33 platform, citing safety
concerns. The platform in mid-July reported a vapor leak that did not
cause any injuries or damage but sparked union complaints. "With the goal of protecting the safety of operations and
the workers ... the National Petroleum Agency decided to
suspend operations on the P-33 platform until the levels of
security required by the (agency) are reestablished," the
agency said in a statement. The P-33 platform operates the Marlim field in the Santos
Basin, off the coast of the state of Rio de Janeiro, with a
production capacity of 63,000 barrels per day. But Petrobras said it had not been told by the agency about
a closure of the platform. "As soon as we become aware of the decision, Petrobras will
make itself available to immediately adopt the agency's
technical recommendations as quickly as possible," the company
said in a statement. In another incident, a small fire broke out on Wednesday at
the Petrobras P-35 platform, also in the Campos Basin, the
company reported on Thursday. It said the fire was quickly
controlled with no workers injured and no equipment damaged. The company said that fire, which did not affect platform
operations, was also caused by a leak in a vapor pipe. Since the massive BP (BP.L) spill in the Gulf of Mexico,
some environmentalists have raised questions about Brazil's
offshore oil industry, operating in increasingly deep waters. Petrobras and Brazilian authorities say safety standards
are strong enough to continue deep water operations without
threatening the environment. (Reporting by Brian Ellsworth and Denise Luna; Editing by
