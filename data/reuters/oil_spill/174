LONDON Aug 11 (Reuters) - BP Plc (BP.L), which last week
plugged its blown-out Gulf of Mexico oil well that caused the
U.S.'s worst oil spill, said it has delayed plans to drill
offshore Libya.

 Spokesman David Nicholas said BP was now expecting to drill
later this year, after predicting on July 1 that BP would begin
in a "few weeks".[ID:nLDE6601CB] "We're working through the detailed planning," Nicholas
said. BP's Libyan plans have aroused suspicion in the United
States where politicians are pressing for an inquiry into
whether BP pressured Scotland's regional government into
releasing the convicted Lockerbie bomber Abdel Basset al-Megrahi
in order to smooth an oil deal with Libya. The Scottish executive has denied the allegation.
