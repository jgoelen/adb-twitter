WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Plains Exploration &amp; Production Co paid nearly $900,000 in civil penalties for failing to submit monthly reports on the company's energy production on federal government leases, the U.S. agency that oversees oil and natural gas drilling said on Friday.

It is one of the biggest financial penalties collected by the Interior Department's new Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, which was formed in response to the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.The new bureau replaced the department's Minerals Management Service, which was dismantled for being too cozy with the oil companies it was supposed to regulate.The BOEM said it issued the civil penalty to Plains Exploration after it repeatedly failed to comply with requests to submit monthly oil and gas operations reports for Pogo Producing Company, which Plains merged with in November 2007.The company has now submitted all the required monthly production reports."We will aggressively pursue every dollar due from energy production on federal and American Indian lands," said BOEM Director Michael Bromwich. "BOEM auditors are continuing to closely examine all reports from companies to ensure that they are accurate and submitted on time, with no exceptions."Plains Exploration is based in Houston and the company primarily explores and produces oil and natural gas. Its core operations are in California, Texas, Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico.(Reporting by Tom Doggett; Editing by Gary Hill)
