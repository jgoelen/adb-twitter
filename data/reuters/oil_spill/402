LONDON (Reuters) - European shares are set to open flat to slightly higher on Thursday, as investors await interest rate decisions from the Bank of England and the European Central Bank (ECB), while company earnings were mixed.

Germany's Commerzbank (CBKG.DE) raised its outlook after forecast-beating second quarter, and UK bank Barclays (BARC.L) beat expectations with a 44 percent rise in half-year profit as bad debts dropped and it made a big accounting gain, offsetting a second-quarter slowdown at its investment bank.By 2:46 a.m. ET, futures for the STOXX Europe 50, Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 were flat to 0.2 percent higher.At 7 a.m. ET, the Bank of England's rate-setters will almost certainly keep borrowing costs at a record low in August and will likely leave policy loose for many months as they wait for more evidence the recovery is taking hold.With inflation in the 16-country euro zone still undershooting and the region's recovery remaining in a delicate phase, the ECB is expected to leave interest rates at a record low 1.0 percent for the 15th month running at 7:45 a.m. ET.The focus of the post-rate decision news conference will be whether the ECB sees the euro-zone economy maintaining its recent blistering form.Investors' attention will also be on the latest U.S. weekly jobless claims, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, a key indicator ahead of Friday's always-important U.S. monthly jobs report."There's no escaping the imminent nature of Friday's non-farm payrolls. The ADP payroll survey bettered expectations so some may be hoping this adds further support in the short term to sentiment," said Cameron Peacock, market analyst at IG Markets.U.S. stocks rose in thin trade on Wednesday as retailers' earnings and a report showing a slight improvement in private employment boosted optimism ahead of Friday's payrolls report.Asian stocks edged higher on Thursday after solid corporate earnings, including from Toyota Motor and chipmaker UMC, and strong U.S. economic data that lifted the beaten-down dollar.European equities ended flat on Wednesday as better-than-expected U.S. services and private sector employment figures offset weaker retail shares that fell on concerns of a decline in consumer demand.The Euro STOXX 50 .STOXX50E, the euro zone's blue-chip index, rose 0.2 percent to 2,825.08 points to stay above its 200-day moving average and the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the index's fall from an April high to a May low, generally a bullish signal.COMPANIESBARCLAYS (BARC.L)British bank Barclays Plc (BARC.L) beat expectations with a 44 percent rise in half-year profit as bad debts dropped sharply and it made a big accounting gain, offsetting a second-quarter slowdown at its investment bank.COMMERZBANK (CBKG.DE)Commerzbank hiked its outlook after clearly beating expectations with its second-quarter results, underscoring the recovery trend among Europe's banks.UBS (UBSN.VX)* The Russian unit of UBS (UBS.N) has secured a license for retail deposits, the central bank said on Wednesday, clearing the way for a possible move into retail operations by the Swiss bank.* A FINRA arbitration panel ordered UBS AG late Tuesday to pay $81 million in damages to a Bethesda, Maryland-based cellphone marketer that purchased auction-rate securities through the U.S. brokerage.AVIVA (AV.L)British insurer Aviva on Thursday reported a better-than-expected 21 percent rise in its half-year profit, helped by cost cuts, and said it was confident about its future prospects.ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND (RBS.L)Royal Bank of Scotland and insurer Aviva (AV.L) announced on Thursday plans to start a new distribution partnership, and RBS said it would book a one-off loss as a result of the changes in their agreement.ZURICH FINANCIAL SERVICES (ZURN.VX)Zurich Financial Services, Europe's fourth-largest insurer, said first-half profit fell 10 percent on high catastrophe payouts and provisions to shield against property loan losses in the UK and Ireland.SWISS RE (RUKN.VX)The world's second-biggest reinsurer, smashed expectations with a $812 million net profit in the second quarter as recovering financial markets boosted asset values and investment returns.KBC (KBC.BR)Belgian financial services group KBC beat expectations in the second quarter due to healthy interest income and sharply lower provisions for bad debts and despite reduced earnings from its dealing rooms.AXA (AXAF.PA)AXA Asia Pacific (AXA.AX), subject of an $11.5 billion takeover bid by National Australia Bank (NAB.AX), was placed on trading halt on Thursday, raising fears the bid has run into more difficulty.UNILEVER (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS)Consumer goods giant Unilever narrowly missed forecasts with a 3.6 percent rise in second quarter underlying sales on Thursday and warned of rising pressure from competitors and higher commodity costs.DEUTSCHE TELEKOM (DTEGn.DE)Deutsche Telekom reported second-quarter results in line with expectations and confirmed its outlook on the back of solid earnings in Germany, its biggest market.RIO TINTO (RIO.L)Global miner Rio Tinto reported a record first-half profit on Thursday, more than double a year earlier as metals prices recovered and its mines ran close to full throttle supplying China.BP (BP.L)BP can pump cement into its blown-out Gulf of Mexico oil well to begin sealing the leak for good, the U.S. official in charge of the spill said on Wednesday.ROYAL DUTCH SHELL (RDSa.L)The oil giant has won authorization from a federal judge to conduct limited tasks on its now-disputed leases in the remote region off Alaska's northwestern coast.SMITH &amp; NEPHEW (SN.L)Smith &amp; Nephew, Europe's largest maker of replacement knees and hips, said its customers' budgets were being squeezed, after growth in endoscopy and wound care helped it beat second-quarter market forecasts.GIVAUDAN (GIVN.VX)Fragrance and flavor maker Givaudan's first-half net profit beat expectations, helped by rising demand in both emerging and mature markets as retailers restock perfumes.(Reporting by Joanne Frearson)
