Tetra Technologies Inc (TTI.N) warned it may not reach its
capital expenditure forecast of $127 million for 2010 amid the
uncertainty over drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, sending its
shares down 17 percent. "We are running behind the pace we had indicated in the
guidance at the beginning of the year. I think we will catch up
somewhat in the second half of the year, but I would not be
surprised if we came in a bit shy of the guidance," the company
said on a conference call with analysts. The offshore segment took a hit from the oil spill and the
drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico as the utilization of
key assets and services in the region were hurt. These trends
could spill into the third quarter as well, the company said. "Although many of our international markets continued to
grow (during the second quarter), our operations in Mexico were
affected by reduced activity levels in certain regions of the
country," Chief Executive Stuart Brightman said. Shares of the company, which fell to $8.69 in late morning
trade Thursday, were trading down 15 percent at $8.88 midday on
the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier in the day, Tetra posted second-quarter earnings
that beat analyst estimates, buoyed by continued improvement in
its domestic onshore business. In the latest second quarter, the company posted a net
income of $13.6 million, or 18 cents a share, compared with
$9.2 million, or 12 cents a share, a year ago. [ID:nASA00M82] Including a non-cash charge of about 8 cents a share
related to the impairment of certain oil and gas properties,
the company earned 26 cents a share. The company said it expects continued growth in onshore
activity with particular emphasis on the shale plays.
