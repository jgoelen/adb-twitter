 By Harpreet Bhal LONDON, Aug 6 (Reuters) - European shares edged up on
Friday, as strong earnings from financials including Royal Bank
of Scotland (RBS.L) helped bolster investors' confidence ahead
of U.S. non-farm payrolls data due later in the session. By 1048 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top
European shares was up 0.4 percent at 1,073.06 points,
rebounding after closing lower in the previous session.
Strong corporate results provided some support to equities.
Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), which is 83 percent state-owned,
rose 2.3 percent as a healthier loan book drove its
second-quarter profits higher. [ID:nLDE6741UI]  Within the banking sector, Barclays (BARC.L), Societe
Generale (SOGN.PA) and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) rose 0.6 to 3.1
percent.  Investors awaited the U.S. Labor Department's employment
report, due at 1230 GMT. Economists forecast nonfarm payrolls
dropped 65,000 after declining 125,000 in June. Private sector
hiring, considered a better gauge of labour market health, is
seen rising 90,000 after increasing 83,000 in June. "With recent noises emanating out of the U.S. indicating
that the Fed may be looking at further monetary easing
options... today's jobs data could provide further clues as to
whether further easing is warranted or not," said Joshua
Raymond, market strategist at City Index.

 Other gainers following results included French bank Natixis
(CNAT.PA), which rose 3.6 percent, after the lender reported
higher-than-expected quarterly results after markets closed on
Thursday, driven by resilient investment banking revenue.
[ID:ID:nLDE6741A3] Anglo-South African financial conglomerate Old Mutual
(OML.L) added 2.8 percent after it reported forecast-beating
first-half results and said it had sold its U.S. insurance
business to simplify its structure. [ID:nLDE67506N] 
 GRAIN PRICE FEARS Soaring grain prices, following Russia's move to temporarily
halt grain shipments, helped push agrochemicals company Syngenta
(SYNN.VX) up 3.5 percent. Russia stunned global grains markets on Thursday by saying
it would ban grain exports from Aug.15 to Dec.31, a move
applying to contracts already signed after the worst heatwave on
record ravaged the country's harvest. [ID:nLDE67413C] Brewers and food producers were hit hard, as the Russian
export ban drove U.S. wheat futures Wc1 up nearly 7 percent in
the previous session before edging down on Friday. Brewers Heineken (HEIN.AS), Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR),
Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) and SABMiller (SAB.L) shed 1.5 to 3.4
percent, while food producers Nestle (NESN.VX), Danone (DANO.PA)
and Associated British Foods (ABF.L) were down 1 to 2.3 percent. Among other movers, BP (BP.L) rose 2.7 percent as the oil
firm finished pumping cement into its ruptured oil well in the
Gulf of Mexico on Thursday to seal off the source of the world's
worst offshore spill. [ID:nLDE6740LH] Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE, Germany's DAX
.GDAXI and France's CAC 40 .FCHI rose 0.5 to 0.7 percent. The Euro STOXX 50 .STOXX50E, the euro zone's blue-chip
index, was up 0.5 percent to 2,833.45 points. It held above its
200-day moving average and the 61.8 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the index's fall from an April high to a May low
at 2,805.95 points.
