 * Company to spend $41 mln over 3 yrs to prevent new leaks * Shares off 1.6 pct Aug 10 (Reuters) - Plains All American Pipeline LP (PAA.N)
has settled with U.S. regulators to pay $3.25 million in a
civil penalty in connection with 10 oil spills in Texas,
Louisiana, Oklahoma and Kansas from 2004-07. About 6,510 barrels of crude oil were discharged from
various pipelines and a tank owned by Houston-based Plains All
American between June 2004 and September 2007, the U.S.
Department of Justice (DoJ) said on its website. The settlement, reached with the DoJ and the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), also requires Plains All American and
its operating subsidiaries to spend about $41 million over the
next three years for preventive measures against any further
leaks or spills, according to the DoJ. The penalty Plains All American is paying for violating the
Clean Water Act will be deposited in the Oil Spill Liability
Trust Fund and used to pay for federal response activities and
to compensate for damages in the event of a discharge, the DoJ
said. "In the last year alone, transportation pipelines released
more than 2 million gallons of oil into the environment, posing
a serious threat to human health and natural habitats," said
Cynthia Giles of the EPA. The terms of the settlement will become effective only
after the approval of the district court for the Southern
District of Texas, Plains All American, which has about 16,000
miles of active crude oil and refined product pipelines and
gathering systems, said in a statement. Shares of the company were down 1.6 percent at $61.91 on
Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, and have dropped 3.3
percent in two sessions.
