 * Lancashire H1 pretax profit $94.6 mln vs $148.2 mln yr ago * Says exposure to Deepwater Horizon 'modest' * Hardy profit knocked by record catastrophe losses
 (Adds Lancashire, Novae comments, background, share prices) By Lorraine Turner LONDON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Lloyd's of London insurer
Lancashire Holdings (LRE.L) beat forecasts with its first-half
pretax profit as it escaped a big hit from the Gulf of Mexico
oil spill, while rates for energy-sector insurance rose. A record number of catastrophes, including the spill at oil
major BP's (BP.L) Deepwater Horizon rig and the Chile
earthquake, have hit the results of non-life insurers, along
with limp investment returns. RSA Insurance Group (RSA.L), the UK's largest non-life
insurer, said on Thursday that its first-half profit was dented
by the cost of the Chile earthquake and bad weather in Europe.
[ID:nLDE674091] But Lancashire, a Bermuda-based insurer, said it had only a
modest exposure of $25 million net to the Deepwater Horizon
loss, despite being one of the largest insurers of energy risks.
[ID:nLDE644095] "We insured against the physical loss of the platform and
had only de minimus exposure to the casualty side of the loss,
which we believe will prove complex and expensive to resolve,"
7Chief Executive Richard Brindle said. The Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion and oil spill has
led to reinsurers bumping up their prices for offshore
energy-related insurance premiums by 50 percent. Moody's
estimated that the total insured loss from the worst oil spill
in U.S. history are between $1.4 billion and $3.5 billion in
June. [ID:nLDE6520QU] Lloyds of London LOL.UL estimated the net claims from the
Deepwater Horizon explosion stood at between $300 million and
$600 million in June. [ID:nLDE6520QU] Lancashire reported a first-half pretax profit of $94.6
million, compared with $148.2 million in the same period last
year, ahead of analysts' expectations, after it profited from
better energy rates. "The market generally feels soft outside of energy," said
Jonny Creagh-Coen, head of investor relations at Lancashire. "We've got a nice weighting towards energy, and that will
come through in 2011 as the majority of the business was written
before Deepwater Horizon happened, but the rate increases only
came through in June and July," he added. Lancashire said its combined ratio -- a measure of
profitability for insurers -- was at 77.4 percent for the first
half, despite the high level of catastrophe losses. A level
below 100 percent indicates a profit. "Lancashire has proved itself as a talented and highly
disciplined underwriter. In H1 it proved its critics wrong by
outperforming," said Christian Stobbs at KBC Peel Hunt. 
 SECTOR STRUGGLES Lloyd's peer Hardy Underwriting (HDU.L) said first-half
returns were down on lower investment returns and record
catastrophe losses. Hardy, with a market value of 111.2 million pounds, was hit
harder than its peers by losses relating to Chile and Australian
hailstorms, though analysts say it is also lined up to benefit
from higher rates in the event of an active U.S. windstorm
season. Analysts also expect catastrophe specialist Lancashire to be
a key beneficiary in the event of a major storm this year.
[ID:nLDE66B09V] Hardy narrowly missed plunging into the red, reporting a
pretax profit of 0.8 million pounds, compared with 7.8 million
last year on a combined ratio of 101.7 percent, against 71.4
percent last year. Marine and aviation and specialty lines helped lift the
combined ratio after a strong performance during the first half. Another Lloyds insurer, Novae (NVA.L), swung to a first-half
underlying pretax profit of 13.6 million pounds from a loss of
2.1 million last year, and a combined ratio of 100.5 percent,
down from 110.5 percent. "It was an awkward first half for the industry because there
were industry-wide losses, dwindling investment returns,
continuing soft rates, but we delivered a solid set of numbers,"
said Novae's chief executive, Matthew Fosh. He added that the insurer is progressing with its plans to
return capital to shareholders, which is on track to be
completed by the end of the year. Shares in Lancashire were down 0.28 percent at 1117 GMT,
Novae was up 1.74 percent, Hardy rose 6.43 percent, while RSA
was up 4.12 percent.
