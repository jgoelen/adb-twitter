MIAMI (Reuters) - A tropical depression formed over the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday on a track likely to take it near BP Plc's massive oil spill site before it makes landfall in Louisiana.

The U.S. National Hurricane Center said the depression, packing top sustained winds of 35 miles per hour, was about 375 miles southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River.The depression was likely to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Danielle on Wednesday but no major strengthening was forecast, with maximum sustained winds likely revving up to no more than about 45 mph, the Miami-based hurricane center said.As a precautionary measure, the approaching storm already prompted BP to delay final work by two to three days on a relief well to permanently kill the source of the world's worst offshore oil spill.Computer models forecast the tropical depression will move northwest, crossing the spill site before making landfall in Louisiana or elsewhere along the north-central Gulf coast by Wednesday night or early Thursday.The 2O10 season has seen only three tropical storms so far, with only one reaching hurricane strength.The season is nearing its traditionally most active phase, which runs from mid-August through October. Hurricanes feed on warm water and the tropical Atlantic is warmest during that time.U.S. government scientists last week reduced their forecast for the 2010 season, but said they were still predicting a very active year of eight to 12 hurricanes.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said it now expected 14 to 20 tropical storms, with eight to 12 of those strengthening into hurricanes.It forecast that four to six of them would become "major" hurricanes, which are ranked at Category 3 or above on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of intensity and have top winds of more than 110 mph.Before the six-month season began on June 1, NOAA had forecast 14 to 23 tropical storms, with eight to 14 developing into hurricanes, and three to seven becoming major hurricanes.The revision reflected the lower than expected number of storms that developed in June and July.(Editing by Peter Cooney)
