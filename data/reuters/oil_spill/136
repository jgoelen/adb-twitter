    "China Industrial Waste Management had a strong second quarter as we again
delivered robust growth with strong increases in revenue and earnings," said
Mr. Jason Dong, Chief Executive Officer. "Sales continued to rise as our
customers increased their manufacturing production in the wake of the global
recovery. Our Dongtai Organic business remained a meaningful contributor to
our revenues, and our sales and margins for recycled commodities grew in an
environment where prices were significantly higher than last year. We are
pleased with our performance and believe it is a testament to the high level
of services we provide for our customers and our leadership position in the
fast growing industrial waste management market in China."    Second Quarter 2010 Results    For the three months ended June 30, 2010, revenues were $4.9 million
compared to $2.5 million in the same period last year, an increase of 100.8%.    Revenues from service fees, which consist of service fees generated from
industrial solid waste treatment, sewage treatment and sludge treatment, were
$3.2 million, or 65.5% of revenues, compared to $1.6 million, or 67.0% of
revenues, in the same period last year. The 96.4% increase in revenues from
service fees is mainly attributable to an increase in the Company's solid
waste treatment business, as production volumes from the Company's industrial
customers continue to recover from the lows of early 2009 and sales from
Dongtai Organic, the Company's sludge treatment business, which began
generating revenues in the first quarter of 2010. Dongtai Organic generated
$1.0 million in revenues in the second quarter of 2010.    Sales of recycled commodities were $1.7 million, or 34.5% of revenues,
compared to $0.8 million, or 33.0% of revenues, in the same period last year,
representing an increase of 109.5%. As China's economy continues to recover
from the global recession, prices for many raw materials have been increasing
gradually, including for Dalian Dongtai's main products, cupric sulfate, iron,
plastic and nonferrous metal. To capitalize on this situation, Dalian Dongtai
has selectively sold some of its recycled commodities, including commodities
that had been inventoried during 2009 due to the then prevailing low sales
prices.    Gross profit was $3.1 million compared to $1.6 million in the same period
last year, an increase of 93.9%. Gross margin was 62.0% compared to 64.2% last
year. The 220 basis point decrease in gross profit margin is primarily
attributable to the additional overhead imposed by sludge treatment operations,
a recently-added business line which has not yet reached full capacity.    Income from operations was $1.8 million compared to $0.5 million in the
prior year period, an increase of 242.6%. Operating margin increased to 37.3%
from 21.9% in the prior year period. The increase in operating margin is
primarily due to the Company's higher level of sales and operating leverage.    Net income increased 178.3% to $1.2 million from $0.4 million in the same
period last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 141.5% to $0.07 from
$0.03 in the same period last year.    First Half 2010 Results    For the six months ended June 30, 2010, revenues were $$9.0 million
compared to $4.1 million in the same period last year, an increase of 121.9%.
Revenues from service fees, which consist of service fees generated from
industrial solid waste treatment, sewage treatment and sludge treatment, were
$6.2 million, or 68.4% of revenues, compared to $2.8 million, or 69.9% of
revenues, in the same period last year, an increase of 117.3%. Dongtai Organic
generated $2.0 million in revenues in the first half of 2010. Sales of
recycled commodities were $2.8 million, or 31.6% of revenues, compared to $1.2
million, or 30.1% of revenues, in the same period last year, representing an
increase of 109.5%.    Gross profit was $5.7 million compared to $2.5 million in the same period
last year, an increase of 133.1%. Gross margin was 63.5% compared to 60.5%
last year. Income from operations was $3.4 million compared to $0.7 million in
the prior year period, an increase of 373.0%. Operating margin increased to
37.7% from 17.7% in the prior year period.    Net income increased 188.6% to $1.8 million from $0.6 million in the same
period last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 151.0% to $0.10 from
$0.04 in the same period last year.    Financial Condition    As of June 30, 2010, the Company had accounts receivable of $4.9 million
compared to $2.0 million as of December 31, 2009. The 140% increase is
primarily due to Dongtai Organic, which had service fees due from the local
government for sludge treatment services rendered and sales of methane gas and
from Dalian Dongtai's increase in sales as its customers ramped up their
production levels and produced more waste.    As of June 30, 2010, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $4.8
million compared to $11.4 million as of December 31, 2009. The decrease is
mainly due to the repayment of bank loans. As of June 30, 2010, the Company
had a working capital surplus of $2.9 million compared to a surplus of $1.7
million as of December 31, 2009. During the first half of 2010, operating cash
flow was $0.9 million versus negative cash flow from operations of $1.0
million in the prior year period.    Recent Developments    In August 2010, China Industrial Waste Management signed a major waste
management contract with a national petrochemical firm located in Liaoning
Province (the "Customer"). Under the terms of the contract, beginning on
September 1, 2010, Dalian Dongtai will treat and dispose of the industrial
waste sludge and slag generated by the Customer's production over the next
30-months, which the Customer estimates will total approximately 40,000 tons.
Based on this expected volume, Dalian Dongtai anticipates it will generate an
additional $3.65 million in revenues from this Customer over the life of the
30-month contract.    In July 2010, China Industrial Waste Management was approached to lead the
oil waste management operation following China's largest recorded oil spill
off the coast of Dalian City. The Company was asked to handle oil waste
generated by the effort, including oil skimmed off the ocean surface and
oil-saturated equipment and refuse such as used absorption felts.    In July 2010, the Company received a government subsidy of RMB 5 million
(approximately $0.7 million) to complete its capacity expansion project for a
centralized hazardous waste treatment facility (the "Expansion Project") in
Dalian, Liaoning Province, China. This subsidy is the second installment of a
series to be disbursed by the government as the Expansion Project progresses.    Business Outlook for 2010    Mr. Dong added, "As we enter the second half of 2010 we are proud of the
progress our business has made and optimistic about the future of our company.
Our core Dalian Dongtai solid waste treatment business has rebounded strongly
from the lows of last year as our customers' production volumes continue to
recover and we see this trend continuing at least through the end of 2010. To
further bolster our capabilities in this market we are currently building one
of the most advanced one-stop service centers for industrial solid waste
treatment in China. The construction of this Expansion Project is now 70%
complete and we expect it to become operational in the fourth quarter of this
year. Once fully ramped up, this new facility will provide us with 114,000
tons per annum of industrial solid waste treatment capacity, which is double
the capacity of our current plant.    "We are also excited about the prospects for our Dongtai Organic sludge
treatment business. Dongtai Organic operates the first sludge treatment plant
in China and uses anaerobic fermentation technology. This is a
build-operate-transfer or 'BOT' project with a 20-year franchise period.
During this period, this sludge-to-energy plant is expected to dispose of the
sludge derived from all of the sewage treatment plants located in urban Dalian
City. This plant has a designed capacity of 600 tons per day and is expected
to generate approximately 11,000 cubic meters of methane gas once it reaches
its full capacity, which is expected to happen within two years. The project
has generated revenues for us since January 2010 from service fees paid by the
local government and from the sale of methane to the Dalian Gas Company. As
first movers in this space in China, we believe we are well positioned to
operate other BOT projects across the country and our long-term goal is to see
30-40% of our revenues being provided by sludge treatment, a business that is
characterized by stable revenues and strong cash flows and is in-line with the
Chinese government's goal of encouraging sustainable and environmentally
friendly development.    "Overall, as we look at our business going forward, we believe we have
laid the groundwork for future growth. We have invested considerable resources
in expanding our capacity and capabilities, and we are seeing the early
rewards as we execute against our plan. Dongtai Organic's sludge processing
facility and our soon-to-open Expansion Project are among the most advanced in
China, and our other engineering projects demonstrate our considerable
expertise and abilities. We believe our strong quarterly and first half
results are evidence that we are on a compelling and profitable path in what
we believe is a very attractive growth industry in China."    Conference Call    The Company will host a conference call at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on
