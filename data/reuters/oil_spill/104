 Aug 13 (Reuters) - Oil and gas companies have returned personnel
to offshore oil and natural gas  rigs and platforms in the Gulf of
Mexico as the storm threats from Tropical Depression Five ended and
no new storms were forecast for the region.

 There was no impact to either oil or gas production from
Tropical Depression Five in the Gulf of Mexico.

  The U.S. Gulf of Mexico, home to about 30 percent of U.S.
oil production, 11 percent of natural gas production, and more
than 43 percent of U.S. refinery capacity, is often in the path
of hurricanes.

 Forecasters have heightened sensitivity to storm warnings
with forecasts that the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season could be
the worst since 2005, when Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma
caused havoc in the Gulf Coast, damaging oil rigs and
refineries and forcing sharp cuts in production.

 The hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30.

 GULF OF MEXICO PRODUCTION AFFECTED

 * Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said Wednesday it had
received no company reports of oil or gas production cuts in
