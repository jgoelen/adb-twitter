 (Adds comment from Alabama governor, detail) By Verna Gates BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Aug 13 (Reuters) - Alabama is suing BP
Plc (BP.L) (BP.N), Transocean (RIG.N) and Halliburton (HAL.N)
for "catastrophic harm" caused by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill,
the state's attorney general said on Friday. Alabama is the first state to sue BP for damage from the
world's worst offshore oil spill. The decision stems from fear economic victims will be
inadequately compensated and BP will shirk its financial
responsibility, Attorney General Troy King said. "We are making this claim because we believe that BP has
inflicted catastrophic harm on the state ... We are suing them
for the amount it will take to make Alabama whole," King told
Reuters, declining to specify a figure for damages. BP had no immediate comment, a company spokeswoman said. The suit also named Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N), among
others. Transocean owned the doomed Deepwater Horizon drilling rig
that was hired by BP and exploded and sank in April, triggering
the oil spill. Halliburton provided the cement work for the
well while Anadarko was a minority owner. "It is believed the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon was
a blowout relating to the cementing work," the suit said. Alabama's state government is divided over the lawsuit.
Governor Bob Riley said in a statement he opposed the decision
on the grounds that it was premature to sue BP before it has a
chance to pay claims, especially given that the company has
admitted it is responsible. King argued the suit put Alabama in the strongest legal
position and said that, while an out of court settlement was
possible, the next step was discovery and gathering evidence. "WANTON FAILURE" The suit accuses BP and the other defendants of "negligent
or wanton failure to adhere to recognized industry standards of
care." "The defendants' conduct in operating the Deepwater Horizon
and oil well illustrates their scheme to maximize profits and
ignore dangerous risks posed to human health and property," it
said. Louisiana sustained the most damage to its coastline and
waters from the oil spill, which began in April and was plugged
with cement on July 15. Oil also damaged the economies of Mississippi and Florida. The spill has hurt industries including fishing and tourism
and has affected other sectors such as housing. People and
businesses that have sustained losses can claim against a $20
billion BP compensation fund administered by Kenneth Feinberg,
named by the White House as an independent overseer. But Feinberg was undermining efforts by Gulf state
attorneys general to make it possible for spill victims to
claim damages from the fund while retaining the right to sue BP
at a future date, King said. At the same time, he said, BP was seeking to evade its
responsibility despite a high-profile advertising campaign
which states "we will make this right" and promises to honor
all legitimate claims. Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour in July asked his
state's attorney general not to file a suit against BP to give
the federal claims process a chance to work and to allow for a
complete assessment of damage to natural resources.
