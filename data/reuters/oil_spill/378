NEW YORK (Reuters)- Oil prices slipped on Thursday, as disappointing U.S. jobless claims and retail sales data fed doubts about the energy demand outlook the day after a government inventory report showed rising fuel stockpiles.

The dollar weakened broadly, after seesawing, helping to limit crude oil's slide, along with technical support pegged in the area above $81 a barrel.U.S. crude for September delivery fell 46 cents to settle at $82.01 a barrel, trading in a range from $81.56 to $82.48.Front-month ICE Brent crude fell 59 cents to settle at $81.61 a barrel."The weak dollar helped limit crude losses after the jobless claims report. We think crude should be supported above the September contract's 200-day moving average at $81.09 and trading will probably be cautious ahead of the nonfarm payrolls report," said Richard Ilczyszyn, senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago.The key nonfarm payrolls report due on Friday at 8:30 a.m. EDT is expected to show payrolls fell a second straight month in July, down by 65,000, according to a Reuters survey of analysts.U.S. initial claims for unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly last week, the government said on Thursday, underscoring a weak labor market.The jobless claims data combined with a report of weak July retail sales [ID:nN05219163] punctuated the uneasy economic climate and pushed U.S. stocks lower on Thursday ahead of Friday's nonfarm payrolls report.Crude prices were pressured on Wednesday by a U.S. Energy Information Administration report showing U.S. gasoline stockpiles rose unexpectedly last week. The report also revealed distillate stocks rose more than was forecast. &lt;EIA/S&gt;The fuel stocks rise pressured refined products futures and offset a bigger-than-expected drop in stockpiles of crude oil, though they remained well above year-ago levels.On Thursday U.S. RBOB gasoline futures fell 1.06 cents to settle at $2.1644 a gallon. Heating oil futures, the U.S. benchmark distillate, dipped 1.54 cents to settle at $2.1868 a gallon."The market is digesting yesterday's inventory data where we're seeing a build at a time of year when inventories are normally declining. With very little of the driving season left, there is no bull market in gasoline," said Tim Evans, energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York.OPEC oil exports were expected to be lower in the four weeks to August 21, consultancy Oil Movements said, adding support to crude prices.Industry sources were also eyeing developments in the Middle East including Israel's tensions with Lebanon and Iran's dispute with the West over Tehran's nuclear program.While some analysts say the return of a geopolitical premium in the oil price is partly responsible for the rally, others think prices have run ahead of oil market fundamentals.Oil prices on Monday broke out of range-bound trade and moved above $80 a barrel, then pushed to a three-month high of near $83 a barrel before ending slightly lower on Wednesday.(Additional reporting by Robert Gibbons in New York, Emma Farge in London, Alejandro Barbajosa in Singapore; Editing by David Gregorio)
