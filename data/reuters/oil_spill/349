 (Adds more quotes, background, shares) By Walter Gibbs OSLO, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Norwegian seismic company TGS-Nopec
(TGS.OL) said its Gulf of Mexico clients would likely cut
investment in seismic surveys until the U.S. government settles
on a long-term drilling policy in the wake of the BP oil spill. TGS said its second-quarter earnings were hit by fallout
from the spill and that it expected to invest more of its own
cash in 2010 as oil and gas producers, which often share costs,
pull back in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico disaster. "A lot of the industry and some of our customers are taking
a pause to see what type of regulations might arise as a result
of the Deepwater Horizon incident," TGS Chief Executive Robert
Hobbs told analysts at an earnings call on Thursday. "The end of Q2 marked an entry into near-term uncertainty in
deepwater Gulf of Mexico, one of TGS' major markets," TGS said. TGS is a contractor for the oil and gas industry, using
specialty vessels that it owns or leases to scan the seabed for
potential oil and gas deposits. The company's operating profit fell to $33 million in
April-June from $54 million a year ago. That lagged an average
forecast for $36 million from a Reuters poll of 12 analysts.
[ID:nLDE66T14R] Shares in TGS were off 1.36 percent to 87.05 crowns at 0852
GMT, lagging a 0.8 percent rise on Oslo's .OSEBX index. 
 MEXICO GULF EXPOSURE TGS dropped the low end of its revenue target to $550
million from $560 million while leaving the high end at $600
million, guidance that some thought was too optimistic. Analyst Ole Andre Hagen at Fondsfinans said he thought the
company was underplaying risks stemming from the spill. "We're a bit surprised they're not lowering their guidance
more," he said, noting that TGS gets roughly half its revenue
from the Gulf of Mexico -- a proportion far greater than that of
its main competitors Petroleum Geo-Services (PGS.OL),
Schlumberger's (SLB.N) WesternGeco unit and France's CGGVeritas
(GEPH.PA). Hobbs said it was good news for TGS that the new U.S. Bureau
of Ocean Energy Management has indicated a desire to lift its
current moratorium on deepwater drilling in the Gulf. But he
said it remained unclear whether the U.S. would go ahead with a
planned licensing round for the central Gulf in March 2011. "There is a certain amount of risk to that being delayed in
March," he said, "and we will just have to wait and see as
announcements are made out of the U.S. government." If that licensing round takes place as scheduled, he said,
there "could be an upside" to TGS's Gulf of Mexico business. In the meantime, with oil and gas producers spending less,
TGS-Nopec raised its own 2010 multi-client investment guidance
to $300-330 million from $270-300 million. Dobbs maintained his company's view that long-term prospects
for seismic exploration in the Gulf remain good.  He said a long-term drilling prohibition may actually boost
seismic sector revenues as producers with a long-term commitment
to the Gulf reallocate their drilling budgets to other
activities, including more seismic studies.
