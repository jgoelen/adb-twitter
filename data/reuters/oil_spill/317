 (Adds shipowner's comment, details) By Erika Solomon DUBAI, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Investigators have found traces of
explosive on a Japanese supertanker damaged near the Strait of
Hormuz last week and conclude the ship was the target of an
attack, the United Arab Emirates news agency said on Friday. The 31 crew aboard the 333-metre-long M.Star reported an
explosion shortly after midnight on July 28, injuring one seaman
but causing no oil spill or disruption to shipping in the
strategic waterway. "An examination carried out by specialised teams has
confirmed that the tanker has been the subject of a terrorist
attack," the state news agency WAM said, quoting an unidentified
coastguard source. "UAE explosives experts who collected and examined samples
found a dent on the starboard side above the water line and
remains of home-made explosives on the hull", the source said. A spokeswoman for shipowner Mitsui O.S.K. (9104.T) said the
company could not confirm details of the WAM report. "The investigation on the tanker is still continuing, and
while we are looking at all possibilities, the company has not
heard anything that will help determine the cause of the
damage," she said. A spokesman for the U.S. Fifth Fleet, part of an
international coalition of navies that patrol Gulf waters,
confirmed U.S. Navy divers had played a part in investigations
but had no immediate comment on the UAE report. The report said the M.Star had left UAE waters to resume its
voyage to Japan and trade sources confirmed the ship's
departure. 
 SEVERAL THEORIES Industry sources said the tanker carried more than 2 million
barrels of Qatar Land and Abu Dhabi Lower Zakum crudes,
equivalent to about half of Japan's daily oil needs. The M.Star incident provoked several theories about the
cause, ranging from a freak wave to a collision with a U.S.
nuclear submarine. Two days ago, a statement from a militant group calling
itself the Abdullah Azzam Brigades, which is linked to al Qaeda,
claimed responsibility for the incident. [ID:nLDE673047] Bordered by Iran, Oman and the United Arab Emirates, the
narrow Strait of Hormuz handles 40 percent of the world's
seaborne oil and is patrolled by U.S. and other warships. Al
Qaeda has threatened to attack shipping there in the past.

comment on the report. Mitsui President Koichi Muto said he did not rule out the
possibility that an attack caused damage to the ship, the Nikkei
business daily said on Friday. [ID:nLDE67508Q]
 The ship was smashed in on the starboard side of its hull
above the water line and a lifeboat was blown off the deck and
windows and doors were smashed.
