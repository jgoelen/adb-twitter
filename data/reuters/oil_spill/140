 * BP promises $500 mln to fix refinery problems

 * BP agrees to work with OSHA on safety * Fine stems from deadly 2005 refinery blast (Adds background, details) By Erwin Seba HOUSTON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - BP Plc (BP.L) (BP.N) will pay a
record $50.6 million fine for lingering safety problems from a
deadly 2005 explosion that killed 15 workers at its Texas City,
Texas, refinery, the U.S. government said on Thursday. The fine is the latest blow dealt to the London-based
energy giant still reeling from the biggest marine oil spill in
U.S. history, where the company faces billions of dollars worth
of fines and other penalties. "The size of the fine rightly reflects BP's lack of regard
for worker safety," U.S. Labor Secretary Hilda Solis said in a
Thursday afternoon news conference.BP will also spend $500 million between 2010 and 2016 to
improve safety at the third-largest U.S. refinery. BP has
already paid a $50 million fine to settle the criminal charges
and also spent more than $2.1 billion to settle hundreds of
lawsuits stemming from the explosion, that also injured 180.Thursday's announcement comes after the Labor Department
Occupational Safety and Health Administration slapped BP with
709 citations carrying a record $87.4-million in fines at the
U.S. refinery in October. As part of the agreement announced Thursday, BP denied the
government's allegations that it failed to live up to the
agreements on refinery safety made after the 2005 explosion.  BP's global head of refining said the company would work
with OSHA to improve refinery safety. "BP has a stated goal to become a leader in process safety
and we look forward to working collaboratively with OSHA to
achieve an injury-free workplace in our operations," said Ian
Conn, global head of refining, in a statement. OSHA said it will continue to seek $30.7 million in fines
for new safety violations found by government inspectors at the
refinery. "BP is hopeful that this agreement will provide a platform
to resolve the remaining citations," the company said in a
statement."  The lead attorney representing victims from the BP
explosion said the company should change its ways. "Hopefully someday soon management at BP will grow tired of
being in the international headlines as the poster child of bad
business practices and reckless abandon," said attorney Brent
Coon in a statement issued by his office. Gary Beevers, international vice president of the United
Steelworkers union, which represents hourly workers at the
refinery, said the agreement opened the refinery to U.S.
government scrutiny. "It's like BP said here's the keys to the refinery, come
in, make some coffee and look at things anytime you want,"
Beevers said.BP also faces a lawsuit by the state of Texas for 40 days of
excess pollution including carcinogenic benzene from the
refinery in April and May. The company was also hit with a $10 billion federal class
action lawsuit earlier this month for the April-May pollution,
which BP reported to state regulators.
