 (cementing operation completed) By Kristen Hays HOUSTON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) (BP.N) finished
pumping cement into its ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico
on Thursday to seal off the source of the world's worst
offshore spill, paving the way to permanently plug the blow-out
later this month. The daylong cementing operation followed earlier injections
of heavy drilling mud this week that had subdued the upward
pressure of oil and gas inside the deep-sea Macondo well. The
crippled wellhead was provisionally capped in mid-July. "This is not the end, but it will virtually assure us that
no oil will be leaking into the environment," retired Coast
Guard Admiral Thad Allen, who oversees the U.S. oil spill
response operation, said at a briefing in Washington. "Monitoring of the well is under way in order to confirm
the effectiveness of the procedure," BP said in a statement
announcing completion of the cementing work. The so-called "static kill" at the top of the well is due
to be finished off with a "bottom kill" later in August with
more mud and cement injected through a relief bore being
drilled into the ruptured well shaft. This relief well is
regarded as the final step in plugging the reservoir 13,000
feet (4,000 metres) beneath the seabed. "I will declare this well dead once we've intercepted the
annulus (the space between the well pipe and surrounding rock)
and we've assessed how much mud or cement we need to do from
the bottom to finally kill this well," Allen said. Allen said BP would likely resume drilling the relief well
24 to 36 hours after the cementing was done, with the initial
intercept expected within five to seven days after that. Progress in shutting off the cause of an environmental
disaster for the U.S. Gulf Coast came as a relief for both BP,
whose image and stock took a beating, and U.S. President Barack
Obama, whose approval ratings suffered over criticism of his
administration's handling of the spill. [ID:nN04250367]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&gt; Reflecting hopes that an end to the 108-day-old drama is
now in sight, BP shares hit two-month highs in early trading in
London. They later fell back, closing up 0.42 percent. BP
shares finished 3 percent higher in New York. BP shares have gained strongly since hitting a 14-year low
on June 25. "Nobody thinks they (BP) are going to go bust in
the next five years any more," said Iain Armstrong, an analyst
at Brewin Dolphin. BP, which has lost over a third of its market value since
the April 20 blast that killed 11 workers, sank the Deepwater
Horizon rig and triggered the spill, has said it would sell
about $30 billion in assets to cover costs related to the
disaster. OFFSHORE DRILLING CONCERNS With the U.S. government announcing this week that some 75
percent of the estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil spewed by
the well has either evaporated, dispersed or otherwise been
contained, some environmental experts say the U.S. Gulf Coast
may have dodged a nightmare scenario. [ID:nN03157658] But the incident has had far-reaching repercussions for the
oil industry from a safety and regulatory point of view. A group of investors, including the two largest U.S. public
pension funds, asked 27 leading oil and gas companies on
Thursday to disclose what they have done to improve offshore
drilling safety in the wake of the BP spill. [ID:nN05150611] Industry experts have warned that new government
regulations and rising insurance costs stemming from the crisis
are expected to drive up the expenses of drilling in the Gulf,
pushing many of the smaller oil and gas producers out of the
prolific energy zone. Independent company Plains Exploration &amp; Production Co
(PXP.N) planned to sell its Gulf of Mexico assets and expand
onshore, due to the regulatory backlash. [ID:nSGE6740J6] Mexico's state oil company Pemex will delay the start of
its Maximino exploration well in the Gulf until next year due
to concerns about deep-water drilling, a regulator said.
[ID:nN05252018] WHERE'S THE OIL GONE? Despite the encouraging announcements from BP and the Obama
administration, many Gulf Coast residents, who have seen their
fishing, tourism and livelihoods devastated by the spill, were
wary, asking where the remnants of the leaked oil had gone. "Where is this remaining oil? It's in the reeds, salt
marshes, mangroves and on the beaches or it's still at sea --
either floating on, in or near the surface," said Simon
Rickaby, chairman of the London-based Institute of Marine
Engineering, Science &amp; Technology (IMarEST) Pollution and
Salvage Special Interest Group. BP and U.S. authorities have said that cleanup efforts,
though being scaled back, would continue. Coast Guard Rear Admiral Paul Zukunft said the fragile but
environmentally important salt marshes of Louisiana -- the
hardest hit of the five Gulf states -- appeared to be more
resilient than expected. During a flyover on Thursday of Barataria Bay, one of the
region's most spill-impacted areas and a prime nursery for its
seafood industry, Zukunft said he saw healthy pelicans diving
for fish. He also said crab traps lined with absorbent boom and
submerged in the marshland have attracted little crude. "There is very little observable oil out there," Zukunft
said, though he added that tar balls are expected to keep
washing ashore for "months, potentially years." Carol Browner, Obama's Energy and Climate Change adviser,
on Thursday assured anxious business owners in the Florida
Panhandle, which suffered oil pollution on some of its beaches,
that the administration would continue to assist them. "I just want to tell you that we are not going anywhere,"
Browner said. "We remain committed. It's an important regional
treasure, but it's also a national treasure," she said,
referring to the state's famous white-sand beaches. Hundreds of miles of shoreline have been soiled by the
spill, which also has killed thousands of birds and other
wildlife, idled much of the region's fishing and tourism
industries and ultimately cost the job of BP Chief Executive
Tony Hayward, widely criticized as seemingly insensitive. BP, which faces an avalanche of economic damage lawsuits,
has said it will pay all legitimate claims. Transocean Ltd (RIGN.VX) (RIG.N), which operated the
destroyed rig, reassured investors that BP would bear most of
the liability linked to the spill. [ID:nN05135581]
