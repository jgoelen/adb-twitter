 *Boone's BP Capital cuts shares in Transocean

 *Adds a number of onshore gas drillers to stock holdingsNEW YORK Aug 16 (Reuters) - If T. Boone Pickens' stock
picks are any indication of where the "smart money" in energy
is headed, it's onshore. His firm, Dallas-based BP Capital, cut its number of shares
in offshore driller Transocean Ltd (RIGN.VX) (RIG.N) by 144,072
and added 314,865 shares to its holdings in onshore shale gas
driller Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N), according to a
quarterly securities report filed Monday with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Fund managers are required to say what they owned 45 days
after the quarter ends. BP Capital added shares of several onshore natural gas
drilling companies to its portfolio that it didn't have in its
first quarter holdings including 190,454 shares of Devon Energy
Corp (DVN.N), 599,788 shares of Quicksilver Resources Inc,
(KWK.N), and 189,507 shares each in Encana Corp (ECA.TO) and
Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN.N). The firm took 94,753 shares in Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and
65,380 shares in coal mining company Massey Energy (MEE.N)
during the second quarter, according to SEC filings. The firm's monetary holdings in Transocean were down from
nearly $30 million in the first quarter to $9.3 million in the
second quarter, according to the filings. The offshore driller's stock price slid by about $50 per
share between April 20 and June 9 after the Deepwater Horizon
offshore drilling rig, which it owned, and which was under
lease by multinational oil company BP (BP.L) (BP.N) exploded
and sank, causing the world's worst offshore oil spill. Pickens has long advocated for natural gas-fueled vehicles
and has publicly declared himself a proponent of domestically
produced natural gas. BP Capital spokesman Jay Rosser said the firm does not
comment on SEC filings or on the firm's stock holdings.
