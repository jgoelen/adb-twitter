 * WTI futures timespread narrows slightly

 * U.S. crude and product stocks at record high levels * Possible tropical weather threat to production * Crack spreads near 7-year lows - Tudor Pickering * Market awaits restart for Enbridge Michigan oil line NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. cash crudes could weaken
this week, after U.S. oil and product stockpiles surged to
record levels this month, and as timespreads narrow and crack
spreads are near 7-year lows, traders and analysts said Monday. But some grades may also firm if pipeline reductions cut
the volume of U.S. imports from Canada, with refiners awaiting
a restart of Enbridge's ruptured 6B line in Michigan, or if
tropical weather systems threaten Gulf of Mexico production,
they said. Mars sour MRS- traded at $2.65 below West Texas
Intermediate CLc1 on Monday, on the strong side of its range
of trades from -$2.60 to -$2.85 on Friday. Light Louisiana Sweet LLS- was talked in a range $2.60 to
$3.00 above WTI on Monday morning, stable with Friday's levels.
The WTI front-to-second month timespread narrowed 2 cents to 37
cents a barrel, a factor that can weaken cash crudes. CL-1=R September WTI traded at a 48-cent premium to Brent.
CL-LCO1=R Crude prices have been falling on dimming prospects for
U.S. economic recovery as total U.S. crude oil and petroleum
stocks, including the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, rose to
record highs early this month. September WTI fell 15 cents to
$75.24 on Monday. NYMEX 3-2-1 refinery crack spreads fell last week to $7.38,
near a seven-year low, and spot crude prices were down 4.4
percent last week, according to weekly research from Tudor
Pickering Holt &amp; Co. U.S. refining margins declined in all regions except the
Rockies last week, according to a report from Credit Suisse on
Monday. Margins declined most sharply along the U.S. Gulf
Coast, where they fell $1.62 to $6.12 a barrel. Oil and natural gas producers have not cut back production
in the northern Gulf of Mexico despite a brewing tropical storm
threat, companies said on Monday morning. Leading U.S. Gulf oil producer BP Plc (BP.L) (BP.N) said
offshore operations managers were watching the remnants of
Tropical Depression 5, which re-entered the Gulf overnight.The system has a 60 percent chance of becoming a tropical
cyclone in the next 48 hours, according to the U.S. National
Hurricane Center. The market also was awaiting word when Enbridge Inc
(ENB.TO) might restart its damaged pipeline in Michigan, which
has affected refinery capacity totaling 700,000 barrels per day
but has had little impact on crude markets. The line has been
down since a spill on July 26. Enbridge lowered capacity on its 490,000-barrel-per-day
Line 5, the main alternative to its Michigan pipeline that
ruptured last month, but said on Friday it doesn't expect the
move to reduce shipments on the key line. Enbridge cut rates on the line to Sarnia, Ontario, in order
to carry out additional safety checks, a spokeswoman said. The
reductions shouldn't force Enbridge to change its delivery
schedules for crude already allocated onto the lone, she said.
