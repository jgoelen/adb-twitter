  HONOLULU, HI, Aug 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
In the wake of the recent Gulf of Mexico oil spill, Jack Johnson
announces his support of Gulf Oil Spill recovery efforts. Johnson is due
to embark on the second leg of his "To The Sea" tour, which begins on
August 13th in Salt Lake City, Utah, and continues on to Texas and
through the south to Florida. Many stops on the tour will be in areas
directly affected by the Gulf Oil Spill. 

    As part of the All At Once campaign, Johnson's "To The Sea" tour is
partnering with local and national non-profits in areas affected by the
Gulf Oil Spill to encourage volunteerism and direct donations. These
groups will be featured at www.AllAtOnce.org. Fans can learn more
first-hand in the Village Green at Jack Johnson concerts taking place in
areas affected by the Gulf Oil Spill. 

    In addition, Johnson's newest charity, the Johnson Ohana Charitable
Foundation, is committing up to $70,000 to the All At Once non-profit
partners working on Gulf Oil Spill relief efforts, with $30,000 in direct
donations and up to $40,000 in matching grants. 

    Key All At Once non-profit partners working in the region include Gulf
Waterkeepers, Gulf Restoration Network, Louisiana Bucket Brigade, Ocean
Conservancy, National Wildlife Federation, Surfrider Foundation,
Galveston Bay Foundation, and Tampa Bay Watch. Donations to these groups
will be matched by the Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation (up to $2500
per group).

    Now through August 9th, Jack Johnson will be auctioning off prime seats
to his August shows via TicketMaster with all auction proceeds going
directly to the All At Once non-profit partners working on relief efforts
in the Gulf.

    Johnson is also encouraging his Gulf Coast fans to report the oil spill
impacts that they witness first hand. All At Once non-profit partners
Ocean Conservancy and Surfrider Foundation have collaborated with
CitySourced to develop the SkyTruth Oil Spill Reporter -- a free smart
phone application that empowers Gulf Coast residents to snap and tag
photos of oil on the land, in the water, and affected wildlife. These
citizen reports help prioritize clean-up efforts and document the extent
of the spill for policy makers and the public. www.skytruth.com

    In addition to the non-profit partners working on Gulf Oil Spill relief
projects, Johnson's 2010 To The Sea World Tour is collaborating with over
150 hand-chosen community groups around the globe as part of Johnson's
All At Once Community. This year's All At Once campaign is focusing on
supporting non-profit groups and engaging fans in plastic free
initiatives and sustainable local food systems. As in 2008, Jack Johnson
will donate 100% of his 2010 tour proceeds to charity.
