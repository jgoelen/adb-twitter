BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn made a huge bet on energy stocks during the second quarter after a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico depressed values in the sector, a regulatory filing shows.

Icahn, known for his activist stance in companies such as Biogen Idec (BIIB.O), Genzyme Corp (GENZ.O) and others, reported that he had invested $923 million in energy stocks on June 30, 2010. The filing, made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last week, shows that Icahn had no holdings in energy stocks as of December 31, 2009.Icahn did not reveal the stocks he invested in but may do so when he files his 13F listing of stocks 45 days after the quarter ends. This is required of money managers with more than $100 million in holdings.The filing shows that energy investments make up the third largest holding for the New York-based financier after consumer non-cyclicals and communications stocks.Energy company prices tumbled after BP's oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico exploded in April, creating the largest oil spill in U.S. history.At the end of the first quarter, Icahn's largest holdings were Motorola Inc (MOT.N), Biogen Idec and Genzyme.In last week's filing, Icahn said the energy portfolio may not be made up entirely of publicly traded stocks. Indeed, only $608 million of the securities had quoted prices that were available in active markets. Icahn said that $315 million were in securities that could be corporate bonds and loans, less liquid and restricted equity securities and certain over-the counter derivatives, according to the filing.Icahn's move was first reported by Bloomberg News.(Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by Richard Chang)
