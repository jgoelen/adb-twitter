 (Recasts with regulator rejecting plan) CALGARY, Alberta, Aug 10 (Reuters) - A U.S. regulator on
Tuesday rejected Enbridge Inc's (ENB.TO) plan to restart a
pipeline that spilled oil into a Michigan river system, adding
further uncertainty about how soon it will resume service. Enbridge, which ships most of Canada's crude exports to the
United States, said it filed its plans with an agency of the
U.S. Department of Transportation late Monday as it repaired
the 190,000 barrel a day Line 6B pipeline that ruptured last
month. But the agency, called the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
Safety Administration, said it "found that the plan did not
adequately provide for a safe restart of the pipeline and
lacked sufficient technical details to conclude that no
immediate threats are present elsewhere on the line." It added that it "will not approve any restart plan that
does not include excavating and exposing additional pipe and
repairing or replacing additional pipe as necessary." The ruling is key as the agency must sign off on the
proposed measures before the line can resume flowing crude to
refineries in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Southern
Ontario. The July 26 pipeline break near Marshall, Michigan, caused
19,500 barrels (800,000 gallons) of heavy Canadian crude oil to
leak into the Kalamazoo River system, forcing a cleanup effort
that has involved more than 1,000 workers and tens of thousands
of feet of containment and absorbent boom. The spill arguably gained increased attention against the
backdrop of the much bigger BP (BP.L) disaster in the Gulf of
Mexico. &lt;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Factbox on the impact on refiners [ID:nN05262825] Graphic of the pipeline and refiners affected
here ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&gt; Line 6B, part of Enbridge's 1.7 million bpd Lakehead
system, runs to Sarnia, Ontario, from Griffith, Indiana. At least three refineries in the U.S. upper Midwest have
been forced to cut output due to a shortage of supplies since
the pipeline was taken out of service. Refiners in the Sarnia area have sought alternative crude
sources on other pipelines and made other arrangements to keep
their plants running at normal rates. The shutdown of the pipeline has added pressure to prices
for Canadian heavy crude, market sources say. Shares in Enbridge rose 21 Canadian cents to C$51.83 on the
Toronto Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Its U.S. affiliate, Enbridge
Energy Partners (EEP.N), fell 77 cents, or 1.3 percent, to
$56.60 in New York. ($1=$1.03 Canadian)
