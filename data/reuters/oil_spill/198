WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House oil spill commission has asked the Interior Department to provide details on whether any rigs covered by the agency's blanket deepwater drilling ban are safe enough to resume operations.

In a letter to Michael Bromwich, head of Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the panel asked for more information about the safety reviews that have accompanied the department's drilling moratorium."We are particularly interested in whether individual rigs, or categories of rigs, subject to the moratorium are sufficiently safe to allow the moratorium to be lifted with respect to those rigs," the commission said in the letter released on Monday.The commission, charged with guiding the future of offshore drilling in the aftermath of the BP Plc oil spill, said it plans to weigh the effectiveness of implementing a drilling moratorium following a spill as it makes its recommendations.Interior halted deepwater drilling after a ruptured BP well began spilling millions of gallons of oil into the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.The department's moratorium has come under fire from the oil industry and Gulf coast lawmakers, who argue it will cause long lasting damage to the region's economy as offshore operators move their idle rigs to foreign waters.The moratorium has forced companies like Royal Dutch Shell and Petrobras to postpone major projects and affected rig contractors like Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc and Transocean Ltd.After a federal judge struck down the department's initial ban as too broad, Interior imposed a new ban through November 30.The co-chairs of the seven-member commission, Bob Graham and Bill Reilly, have questioned the need for a lengthy blanket ban on drilling."How hard can it be to put inspectors on each of these rigs... and simply draw some conclusions about safety sufficient to allow some resumption of activity?" Reilly asked at the commission's first public meeting last month.Bromwich has said the agency needs time to determine that adequate safety, containment and response mechanisms are in place before drilling resumes. He expressed hope last week that the drilling moratorium could be lifted "significantly" ahead of the November deadline.The panel said it may discuss the moratorium at its second public meeting scheduled for August 25 in Washington D.C.(Editing by Sofina Mirza-Reid)
