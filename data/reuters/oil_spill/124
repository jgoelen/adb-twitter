BANGALORE (Reuters) - In the oily wake of the BP and Enbridge spills, Canadian energy service firms that coat and maintain pipelines are eyeing lucrative contracts as oil sands majors spend more to prevent similar industry-tainting accidents.

Increased spending on pipelines will drive margins at companies such as ShawCor Ltd (SCLa.TO) and North American Energy Partners Inc (NOA.TO) (NOA.N), which saw a lull in new energy projects last year."If you take something as seemingly pedestrian as pipe coating and maintenance and add a lot of technology, like ShawCor does, then producers are going to pay a premium," Macquarie Research analyst Scott Treadwell said.The Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO) pipe break in Michigan, coming hard on the heels of the far bigger BP Plc (BP.L) disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, is raising regulators' scrutiny and spurring demand for better technology and equipment in Canada's burgeoning oil sands industry.That should benefit other oilfield services and equipment providers like Flint Energy Services Ltd (FES.TO), Mullen Group (MTL.TO), Trican Well Service (TCW.TO), and Garneau Inc GARh.V.Moreover, potential gains from oil sands investment have not yet been factored into energy services stocks, as new contracts will only begin flowing in late this year and into 2011, said Treadwell, who has an "outperform" on Flint and ShawCor."An environmental focus and a greater responsibility in terms of maintenance is a fair assumption going forward. I would expect an increase in spending by oil sands," said CIBC World Markets analyst Jeff Fetterly.He expects to revise higher his earlier estimate that the oil sands industry would increase spending by nearly a third this year to C$14.5 billion, and C$17.5 billion in 2011.PROJECTS IN THE PIPELINEAs lawmakers, regulators and environmental groups look closer at pipelines, analysts reckon big players like Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO), Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO.TO) and Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE.TO) will have little margin for error."Producers really don't want to cut corners when it comes to pipe coating and installations," said Treadwell, who expects ShawCor and Flint to begin announcing new contracts "fairly regularly" later this year.Although pipeline coating and construction companies ShawCor and North American Energy Partners posted disappointing quarterly results, they were both upbeat for the second half.North American Energy is expected to begin work on two new pipeline construction contracts, which will contribute to revenue in its next two quarters.ShawCor, the world's largest pipe coating company valued at $1.9 billion, was scheduled to begin work on TransCanada's (TRP.TO) KeystoneXL pipeline but this has been met with opposition following the Enbridge spill.The company also expects to begin work on the country's No.2 oil producer Imperial Oil's Kearl Lake project.National Bank Financial analyst Brian Purdy expects ShawCor to add C$350-C$400 million in its new pipeline segment this year in the North American market alone, as producers rush to apply a fresh coat to corroding pipelines.North American Energy and Flint Energy, both based in Calgary, Alberta, are likely to be among the biggest gainers from increased oil sands spending.Purdy tips Flint as it caters solely to the North American region, while ShawCor's activities are more global.Suncor, Canada's biggest oil producer and refiner, awarded Flint work on its Firebag 3 oil sands project near Fort McMurray, Alberta, earlier this year. Suncor expects to spend C$3.6 billion on the project in 2010.Last month, Canada's top oil sands companies posted strong profits, helped by firmer oil prices and outlined expansion plans ahead."What you're going to see is producers start to realize the value of technology for pipelines and installations," said Treadwell.(Editing by Ian Geoghegan)
