   * Wins call for bids in Canada's Beaufort Sea

 * 206,000 acres north of the Yukon's Beaufort coast * Canada to review offshore drilling rules CALGARY, Alberta, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N)
has acquired an exploration license for the Beaufort Sea in
Canada's Far North, bidding C$103.3 million ($101 million) as
the country gets set to review offshore drilling following the
BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, which is responsible
for oil and gas activity in the Arctic, awarded Chevron a
205,946 hectare (508,800 acre) block north of the Yukon coast
and just east of the Canada-U.S. boundary. The acreage was up for grabs as part of a 2009-10 call for
bids. It follows a nearly C$600 million acquisition of Beaufort
Sea exploration rights in 2007 by Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO.TO) and
Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and a C$1.2 billion winning bid for
acreage by BP Plc (BP.L) the following year. Last month, the three formed a joint venture to explore on
their parcels to avoid duplication of equipment and personnel
in the remote, icy region. Imperial said the partners will not start exploratory work
until after Canada's National Energy Board completes its review
of offshore safety and environmental impact. The regulator
announced to review after the BP oil spill in the Gulf of
Mexico. When the NEB announced the review in May, it canceled a
planned hearing on a request from BP and Exxon to reexamine a
requirement that Arctic drillers need to drill a relief well in
the same season that an exploratory well is completed. There is no date yet for when the review is to begin. Chevron is operating Canada's only current offshore
drilling project, the deep water Lona 0-55 well in the Orphan
Basin off the coast of Newfoundland. It is expected to reach
its target depth next month. ($1=$1.02 Canadian)
