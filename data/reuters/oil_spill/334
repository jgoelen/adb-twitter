 * FTSE down 0.6 pct as U.S. jobs data dents confidence

 * Banks down, RBS results * Miners wane as risk appetite ebbs 
 By David Brett LONDON, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Britain's top shares fell on
Friday, led by banks and miners, after weak jobs data cast doubt
over the sustainability of the economic recovery in the United
States and sapped earlier momentum. The FTSE 100 .FTSE index closed down 33.39 points, or 0.6
percent, at 5,332.39, falling from a session high of 5,408.06. The index again failed to finish above the psychologically
important 5,400 level, which it has not managed since May 13. U.S. employment fell for a second straight month in July as
more temporary census jobs ended while private hiring rose less
than expected, pointing to an anaemic economic recovery. In addition, the U.S. government revised payrolls for May
and June to show 97,000 fewer jobs than previously reported.
[ID:nN05598486] "Worries over the risk to the U.S. recovery have replaced
European sovereign debt fears for the time being, and the
uncertainty is weighing on equities," said Jimmy Yates, head of
equities at CMC Markets. "All eyes will now be on the U.S. Federal Reserve to see
what measures, if any, it may take to maintain the economic
recovery." In London, banks, which led on the upside for much of the
day after Royal Bank of Scotland's (RBS.L) bullish results, were
the sharpest fallers RBS, 83 percent state-owned, reported lower impairment
losses which helped its second quarter operating profit rise
from the first quarter. [ID:nLDE6741UI] RBS's shares closed 1.7 percent lower, failing to hold on to
early gains as investors lost their appetite for risk and banked
profits. Peer Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L), which posted strong
results on Wednesday, fell 3.0 percent, and HSBC (HSBA.L) shed
1.1 percent. 
 MINERS RETREAT Miners also added their weight to the downside as investors
sold out of riskier positions and sentiment turned negative. Lonmin (LMI.L), the world's third-biggest platinum producer,
was the top faller in the sector, down 5.2 percent. Analysts
said a South African government ban on Lonmin's sales could be a
serious threat to its business. [ID:nLDE6750KS] Among other blue chip fallers, household products firm
Unilever (ULVR.L) shed 2.7 percent as both UBS and ING
downgraded their ratings for the firm after it warned of a tough
second half due to higher commodity cost and stiff competition
after reporting higher second-quarter sales on Thursday. Food producers and brewers fell as traders cited worries
about the impact of soaring grain prices. AB Foods (ABF.L) and
SABMiller (SAB.L) lost 1.5 and 2.4 percent, respectively, and
Diageo (DGE.L) was down 2.2 percent. Insurers had mixed fortunes with Aviva (AV.L), which posted
results in the previous session, falling 3.2 percent and erasing
most of Thursday's gains. Old Mutual (OML.L) gained 0.7 percent after the Anglo-South
African firm posted a better than expected 43 percent jump in
half-year profit, helped by cost cuts. The group also said it had sold its U.S. life insurer for
$350 million to hedge fund Harbinger Capital. [ID: nLDE67506N] Elsewhere on the upside, satellites operator Inmarsat
(ISA.L) was the top FTSE 100 riser, adding 4.0 percent after it
reported above-forecast second-quarter results and a $1.2
billion satellite fleet order. [ID:nLDE675056] Oil major BP (BP.L) rose 0.5 percent. BP finished pumping
cement into its ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico on
Thursday to seal off the source of the world's worst offshore
spill. [ID:nLDE6740LH] (Editing by David Cowell)
