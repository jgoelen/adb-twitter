 (Updates with details, commentary) By Claire Sibonney TORONTO, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Toronto's main stock index
edged lower in wobbly trading on Friday morning after a slew of
mixed data suggested tepid economic growth for the United
States. The heavyweight energy, financial and materials sectors
were down, but the gold mining group, off more than 1 percent,
was the biggest drag on the index as the price of the precious
metal retreated from a one-month high after the somewhat
positive U.S. retail sales and inflation data. [GOL/] Barrick Gold Corp (ABX.TO) lost 0.7 percent to C$44.75
while Goldcorp Inc (G.TO) shed 1.3 percent to C$41.46. A Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey found U.S.
consumer sentiment inched up in early August and U.S. business
inventories rose in June to their highest level in a year, but
sales fell. Earlier, data showed U.S. retail sales rebounded in July
but showed hints of lingering economic softness, underscored by
separate figures indicating underlying inflation pressures were
stuck at their lowest level since the 1960s. [ID:nN13180040] "From what I saw (the U.S. inflation and retail sales data)
wasn't horrid but it wasn't great. It was kind of in line with
expectations," said Bruce Latimer, a trader at  Dundee
Securities. "We've had a little profit-taking in the market this week
and I think you're going to start to see people step in at
certain levels and start to acquire stocks that they feel are
undervalued." At 10:43 a.m. (1443 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's
S&amp;P/TSX composite index .GSPTSE was off 11.16 points, or 0.1
percent, at 11,512.44. Six of the 10 main sectors were lower. BlackBerry maker Research In Motion (RIM.TO) fell another
1.2 percent to C$55.77 despite its giving assurances to India
on access to encrypted services. [ID:nBMA008251] Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO) rose 0.2 percent to C$50.53 after
the company said it has not been forced to ration oil shipments
on its North American pipeline system because of its Michigan
oil spill. [ID:nN12132779] Cameco Corp (CCO.TO) lost 0.6 percent to C$25.87 after the
top uranium producer reported a weaker second-quarter operating
profit, as results were hurt by lower sales volumes and a lower
realized selling price. [ID:nN05169592] Loblaw Cos (L.TO) added 1 percent to C$43.43 after
announcing it will close its Halifax distribution center in
Nova Scotia to reduce excess capacity in the Atlantic region.
[ID:nSGE67B0NS] Alimentation Couche-Tard (ATDb.TO) rose 0.3 percent to
C$21.46 after U.S. rival Casey's General Stores (CASY.O), which
is fighting a hostile takeover bid, urged shareholders to vote
against an attempt by Couche-Tard to gain influence over its
board of directors. [ID:nN1263190] ($1=$1.04 Canadian)
