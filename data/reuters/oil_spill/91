HOUSTON Aug 14 (Reuters) - BP Plc (BP.L) will get the
go-ahead to finish a relief well to finally seal its blown-out
well in the Gulf of Mexico but is doing a last batch of testing
and planning first, the top government official overseeing the
Gulf of Mexico oil spill said on Saturday.

 The final go-ahead could come by Tuesday, retired Coast
Guard Admiral Thad Allen told a teleconference news briefing.
After the final go-ahead, it could be 96 hours before final
intercept of the damaged Macondo well occurs, he said.
