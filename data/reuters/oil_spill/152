BANGALORE (Reuters) - WW Grainger Inc's (GWW.N) daily sales for July saw a jump of 21 percent, as the industrial distributor benefited from the sale of safety-related items for the oil spill clean-up in the Gulf of Mexico and hot weather in the United States.

Excluding the contribution from acquisitions and foreign exchange, WW Grainger's daily sales rose 15 percent.WW Grainger, which offers products such as oil booms, degreasers and safety supplies among other things, said sales related to the oil spill clean-up are expected to contribute to sales growth for the near term, but at a reduced rate than it experienced in July.Millions of gallons of oil has poured into the Gulf of Mexico since an April 20 blast on the Deepwater Horizon rig triggered a huge spill, soiling 160 kilometer of coastline."There was an increase in sales related to the oil spill clean-up in the Gulf of Mexico, particularly safety-related items such as boots, goggles and protective outerwear," the company said.The products sale related to the oil spill clean-up contributed 3 percentage points. Seasonal related product sale contributed 1 percentage point, which was helped by the hot temperature in the United States in July.Shares of the company closed at $113.38 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.(Reporting by Megha Mandavia in Bangalore; Editing by Don Sebastian)
