 * Whitney National selected to cash checks for claimants

 * Sees marketing opportunity in BP escrow fund role * Has provisioned for credit losses connected to spill By Dave Clarke WASHINGTON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Whitney National Bank
(WTNY.O), a Gulf Coast bank whose bottom line has suffered
because of the region's massive oil spill, is hoping to benefit
from its new role cashing checks for residents who have settled
claims with BP Plc (BP.L).BP has set up a $20 billion escrow fund to pay claims from
individuals and businesses affected by the oil spill. It made
its first contribution to the fund, in the amount of $3
billion, on Aug. 9.The oil company and the U.S. Justice Department announced
earlier this week that Citigroup (C.N) will serve as the fund's
trustee and that claimants can cash their checks free of charge
at one of the 160 Whitney National Bank branches spread across
Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas and Florida.The bank, which is headquartered in New Orleans and has more
than $11 billion of assets, has been struggling financially and
blames some of its recent troubles on the oil spill.David Frady, an executive vice president at Whitney, said
the bank's new role in the oil spill settlement process could
provide it with a marketing opportunity by allowing it take a
front line role in helping residents deal with the disaster's
fallout."Brand equity is a major driver of economic value for the
company and that's what we're all about," he said.In the second quarter Whitney Holding Company, which serves
the Gulf Coast region through Whitney National Bank, reported a
net loss of $18 million.Of the $59 million provision it took for credit losses in
the quarter, the bank attributed $5 million to outstanding
loans affected by the spill's impact on tourism.The company also said uncertainty regarding the impact of
the oil spill on its markets had tempered its optimism for the
second half of 2010.Frady said the bank will hold enough funds to cover the
checks being cashed but that the bulk of the escrow account
will be overseen by Citigroup. Any costs related to
administering the program will be paid by BP."It's sort of a win-win proposition," he said.
