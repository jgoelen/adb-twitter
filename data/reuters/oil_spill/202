 * BP suspends relief well drilling due to storm

 (Adds court venues announced, fishing area opened) By Kristen Hays HOUSTON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - An approaching storm in the
Gulf of Mexico will delay BP Plc's (BP.L) (BP.N) work on a
relief well, the final step in permanently killing the source
of the world's worst offshore oil spill, by two to three days,
the top U.S. spill official said on Tuesday. BP suspended work on a relief well aiming to bore into its
blown-out Macondo well after the National Hurricane Center said
the system had a 70 percent chance of becoming a tropical
depression in the next two days as it moves toward the
Louisiana coast. "This could potentially delay the final portion of the
relief well for two to three days," retired Coast Guard Admiral
Thad Allen told reporters. Separately, a special judicial panel ruled that a New
Orleans federal judge will oversee a swath of civil lawsuits
brought by commercial fishermen and injured workers from the
Deepwater Horizon rig, which exploded on April 20, killing 11
workers and unleashing a nearly three-month undersea oil
gusher. [ID:nN10155602] Securities lawsuits lobbed at BP by stockholders angered by
its steep share price declines will be combined in Houston, the
U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation decided. The
British energy giant has lost over a third of its market value
since the explosion. BP has reserved $32.2 billion to pay legal claims, but
analysts said the eventual bill could run well above that. The biggest U.S. environmental response operation passed a
critical milestone last week by subduing the blown-out
deepwater well with injections of heavy drilling mud, followed
by a cement seal. BP's Macondo well, a mile (1.6 km) down in the Gulf of
Mexico, had been provisionally capped on July 15 after spewing
an estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf, soiling
marshlands, fisheries and tourist beaches along several
hundreds of miles (kilometers) of the Gulf Coast. The relief well is regarded as the final solution to plug
the well 13,000 feet (4,000 metres) beneath the seabed.

crossing the spill site before making landfall in southeast
Louisiana on Thursday. [ID:N10274138] The storm could delay until Tuesday the planned "bottom
kill" of the Macondo well, when the relief well is scheduled to
intersect the well shaft, Allen said. The actual kill operation still could take several days,
officials say. The enormous spill response operation is "moving into a new
phase" to focus on shoreline cleanup and long-term recovery,
Allen said. Crews are in the process of removing protective
booms from the shores of Florida, Alabama and Mississippi, he
said. The government on Tuesday reopened 5,144 square miles
(13,323 sq km) of Gulf waters to commercial and recreational
fishing.About 22 percent of federal waters in the Gulf are now
closed, down from 37 percent at the height of the spill.
