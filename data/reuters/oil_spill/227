Oil Spill Perceptions Could Be Problematic for Future Gulf Coast and Florida
Tourism
SOUTHLAKE, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Though there seems to be progress in stopping the leak in the Gulf, the
misperceptions about oil on beaches may take far longer for the travel industry
to fix. Travelocity recently conducted a poll of over 2,000 Americans and found
that many travelers believe the oil has spread far beyond its actual reach. For
example, one in four respondents named the Florida Keys as one of the top three
destinations they thought were impacted by the spill. One in four also named
Panama City as affected, although the beaches are clean and open. 

Travelocity asked: "Based on what you`ve heard in the news, which would you say
are the top three destinations that you think are most affected by the oil
spill?" The chart to the left illustrates the results of the poll. 

While many travel companies - including Travelocity - have launched pages
dedicated to providing information about Gulf Coast travel, misperceptions
abound. Though it`s impossible to predict the long-term effect these
misperceptions will have on tourism, it may be possible for tourism officials to
lure travelers to the region with good deals. Though 24 percent of respondents
said they were less interested in visiting the Gulf now than before the oil
spill, more than one quarter of those said they would go if they found a
compelling deal. An additional seven percent who were never interested in
visiting would consider a trip if they found a good deal.
