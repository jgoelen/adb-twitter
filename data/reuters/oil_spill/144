 * Vapor leak caused incident on Petrobras P-35 rig

Petrobras (PETR4.SA) said Thursday a small fire broke out on an offshore
production platform but was quickly controlled with no workers wounded and
no damage to equipment. The company said the incident, which took place on Wednesday, was
caused by a leak in a vapor pipe on the P-35 platform operating the Campos
Basin. The fire did not affect the platform's operations, it said. In mid-July, a hot air duct malfunctioned on Petrobras' P-33 platform,
also operating in the Campos Basin, though the company said that incident
also caused no injuries or damages. Brazil's National Petroleum Agency, the country's energy regulator,
said on Tuesday it planned to carry out an inspection of the P-33 platform
following that incident. The country's offshore oil industry, which is operating in increasingly
deep waters, have been questioned by some environmentalists since the
massive BP (BP.L) spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Both Petrobras and Brazilian authorities say safety standards are
strong enough to continue deep water operations without threatening the
environment. (Reporting by Brian Ellsworth and Denise Luna;
