MIAMI Aug 11 (Reuters) - A tropical depression which had
been heading towards BP Plc's (BP.L) oil spill site in the Gulf
of Mexico dissipated on Wednesday, the U.S. National Hurricane
Center said.

 The Miami-based center said the remaining low pressure
area, which was carrying top sustained winds of 30 miles per
hour (45 km/hour), was located about 105 miles (170 km)
east-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River. The remnants of the depression were still forecast to move
ashore on the northern Gulf Coast in the next day or so, with
potential to produce heavy rainfall over the southeast United
States.
