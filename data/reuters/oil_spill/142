ATLANTA, Aug. 12, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PRGX Global, Inc. (Nasdaq:PRGX), the
world's leader in recovery auditing and the pioneer in profit discovery
services, announced that it will host retail finance leaders at two events next
month in New Orleans, Louisiana, the 3rd Annual Retail Finance Leaders
Roundtable (RFLR III) and the new Recovery Audit Thought Leaders event.

"The Retail Finance Leaders Roundtable has proven that creating opportunities
for senior retail finance executives to share insights and success stories on
top-of-mind issues creates significant value," said Romil Bahl, president and
chief executive officer of PRGX Global, Inc. "We are excited to host RFLR III
and add a new recovery audit thought leaders roundtable event." Bahl added, "We
decided to hold both events in New Orleans as one way to contribute to the
economies of a city and region affected by Hurricane Katrina and the recent oil
spill."

PRGX will host RFLR III on September 23 and 24. Retail finance executives
attending RFLR III will focus on discovering and discussing new ways to improve
their company's financial performance using key profit levers available to them
such as improving working capital, partnering with merchandising to improve
financial outcomes, broadening the scope of finance and accounting best
practices, and managing suppliers better.

The Retail Recovery Audit Thought Leaders Conference on September 16 and 17 is
designed for retail finance managers who oversee internal and external recovery
audit efforts, as well as manage teams that track vendor agreements. This
conference will focus on identifying and capturing incremental opportunities in
these important merchandising purchase-to-pay functions.

Both events will feature a roundtable discussion format, with agenda topics
developed by retail finance executives from leading retailers.

"Our conferences are perfect examples of our commitment to foster collaboration
within the retail finance community in that they are designed and led by
retailers for retailers," concluded Bahl. "I am personally looking forward to
the discussions and world-class thought leadership provided by our retail
partners and team members."
