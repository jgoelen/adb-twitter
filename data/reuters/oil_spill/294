 (Adds analyst comment, shares) AMSTERDAM, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Dutch engineering consultancy
Fugro NV (FUGRc.AS) posted a smaller than expected drop in
earnings on Friday, with the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico
having little impact on its activities so far. The company's outlook for the rest of the year was also
ahead of consensus forecasts and its shares touched a 12-week
high. Fugro's shares had lost more than 17 percent of their value
in the wake of the BP (BP.L) oil spill as investors tried to
assess its impact on the deep-sea oil exploration market, where
the company provides some of its services. But Fugro said that only 6 percent of its total revenue
comes from the Gulf of Mexico and that a substantial part of
this is related to servicing existing production and is not
affected by the exploration moratorium. Fugro shares rose 4.7 percent at 0747 GMT, easily outpacing
a 0.9 percent rise for European oil and gas shares .SXEE, as
analysts said its guidance was a relief. "Regarding the outlook, it is clearly better than expected
and we expect consensus will have to move up a touch, which is
clearly a relief following tough developments at some of the
seismic competitors," KBC Securities said in a research note. Fugro posted a 10.1 percent drop in first-half net profit to
101 million euros on revenues that were up 0.7 pct to 1.04
billion, as pricing pressure, driven by oversupply in some of
its markets, continued. Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected a net profit of 98.4
million euros on revenues of 962 million. In a detailed outlook for 2010, Fugro said it expected net
income to come in at around 260 million euros on revenues of 2.2
billion. Analysts in a Reuters poll expect net income of 253
million euros on revenues of 2.07 billion. Fugro, which undertakes studies for the likes of Chevron
(CVX.N), Brazil's Petrobras (PETR4.SA) and India's ONGC
(ONGC.BO), competes for seismic surveys with Norway's Petroleum
Geo-Services (PGS) (PGS.OL) and France's CGGVeritas (GEPH.PA). Fugro trades at 12.6 times estimated 12-month forward
earnings, below PGS and CGGVeritas, which trade at 14.2 and 21.5
times respectively according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, which
weights analyst estimates according to their track record.
