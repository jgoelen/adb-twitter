BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
Suffolk University`s Sawyer Business School will bring together business leaders
and scholars in October for the first Business Complexity and the Global Leader
Conference, a three-day symposium on business complexity, addressing what many
executives say is the single biggest challenge facing their enterprises. 

Today`s business environment has become extraordinarily complex, with systems,
economies and governments so interconnected as to have seemingly moved beyond
management control in many cases. The global financial crisis and the new
regulatory environment that has emerged in its wake have created new
complexities for businesses. Health epidemics such as Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) and the H1N1 virus have impacted business mobility. For BP and
other companies, the complexities surrounding the Gulf oil spill are
mindboggling. 

A recent IBM survey found that the rapid escalation of complexity has become the
single biggest challenge CEOs face, and about half of them doubt their ability
to manage those complexities. Of the more than 1,500 CEOs and other senior
executives surveyed, eight in 10 expect their environment will grow even more
complex. 

While the conversation to date has mostly focused on finding ways to reduce or
avoid complexity in business, Suffolk University`s Business Complexity and the
Global Leader Conference will look at what can be learned from this increasing
complexity that will support more effective leadership. 

"Complexity is a reality," said Greta Meszoely of the Business School faculty,
the conference organizer. "Rather than attempt to try to reduce it or ignore it,
we must acknowledge our increasingly interconnected and complex world. We can no
longer just focus on our internal organizations but instead must develop an
understanding of our role in a connected ecosystem of complex adaptive systems."


The conference, to be held Oct. 18-20, 2010, will be presented by the Sawyer
Business School`s Institute for Executive Education. Thought leaders and
practitioners who will participate include:

* Geoffrey West, theoretical physicist and distinguished professor at the Santa
Fe Institute, who in 2006 was named one of Time magazine`s 100 most influential
people in the world 
* Juan Perez Mercader of Spain's Centro de Astrobiology and Harvard`s Origins of
Life Initiative 
* Cesar Hidalgo, assistant professor with the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology`s Media Laboratory 
* Paolo Gaudiano, president and chief technology officer, Icosystem Corp, which
provides companies and government agencies with predictive analytics. 
* Phil Budden, Britain`s Consul General for New England 
* Marv Adams, executive vice president, TIAA-CREF. His past roles include CIO of
Ford Motor Company, CIO of Citigroup and President of Shared Services at
Fidelity Investments. 
* Paul Pedini, senior vice president, Jay Cashman, Inc., and a civil engineer
who spent a decade working on Boston`s Big Dig Central Artery project.

"The Sawyer Business School is preparing the way for global leaders of tomorrow
and supporting leaders of today," said Professor Michael Barretti, director of
the Sawyer Business School`s Institute for Executive Education and Life-Long
Learning. "Suffolk University is developing programming that will support our
understanding of the underlying forces that have changed our business landscape
in what Stephen Hawking refers to as the `century of complexity.`" 

The Business Complexity and the Global Leader Conference aims to create the
foundation for productive dialogue to support a better understanding of complex
adaptive systems as they relate to business. More information may be found at
