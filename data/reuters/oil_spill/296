 * Relief bore to intersect well shaft in mid-August

 * BP executive says coastal cleanup "far from finished" * BP shares remain buoyed by well shut-off news * Questions remain over ecological, economic impact (Recasts, adds quotes, details, background) By Chris Baltimore HOUSTON, Aug 6 (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) (BP.N) said on Friday
the cement seal on its crippled Gulf of Mexico oil well was
holding and a relief well to permanently plug the ill-fated
borehole was on track to reach its target in mid-August. As the final stages of the long-awaited "kill" operation
moved forward, nagging questions remained about the lasting
environmental and economic impact to the U.S. Gulf region from
the world's worst offshore oil accident. More than 100 days after the start of the catastrophic
spill that ravaged ecologically sensitive wetlands and
lucrative coastal economies, BP said no oil was leaking from
the undersea Macondo well and no "recoverable oil" was left on
the surface of the Gulf of Mexico. BP finished pumping cement on Thursday into the ruptured
well one mile (1.6 km) below the surface after injections of
drilling mud earlier this week subdued the pressure of oil and
gas. The wellhead was provisionally capped in mid-July. The so-called "static kill" at the top of the well is due
to be finished off with a "bottom kill" later in August with
more mud and cement injected through a relief bore that will be
drilled into the well shaft. This relief well is regarded as
the final solution to plug the reservoir 13,000 feet (4,000
metres) beneath the seabed. BP's chief operating officer for exploration and
production, Doug Suttles, told reporters at a briefing the
cement job "appears to be performing as expected." "All of the indications so far look very encouraging," he
said in New Orleans. Engineers were pressure-testing the
injected cement. Retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen, who heads the oil
spill response for President Barack Obama's administration,
said the relief well was scheduled to reach the well shaft
below the seabed "somewhere between August 14th and 15th." "We are unequivocally committed to completing the relief
wells," Allen said in a conference call. A second, back-up
relief well is also being drilled.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&gt; Asked if BP would sell its rights to the Macondo field,
Suttles replied: "We just haven't thought about that." "Clearly there is lots of oil and gas here and we will have
to think about what to do with that at some point," he said. The well's sealing was a relief for both the British energy
giant, whose shares and image have taken a beating from the
spill, and for Obama's administration, which has faced
criticism over its response and has pledged to help the
pollution-struck Gulf Coast recover. BP shares, which have recovered strongly since hitting a
14-year low on June 25, appeared once again to be buoyed by the
news of the progress in plugging the well. They rose more than
2 percent in early London trading before falling back to close
up 0.46 percent. In New York, BP shares were up 1.7 percent in
late-day trading. "FAR FROM FINISHED" Suttles, who had led BP's overall oil spill response in the
Gulf but was now returning to his chief operating officer role
in Houston, nevertheless acknowledged the coastal cleanup
effort was "far from finished." "Clearly we feel like its moving to a new phase because
we've been three weeks without new oil flowing into the sea,
and we don't have oil out on the open water anymore. But we
still have a lot of work around the shoreline," he said. Mike Utsler was appointed to take his place in BP's Gulf
spill response operation. The company has lost over a third of its market value since
the April 20 blast that killed 11 workers, sank the Deepwater
Horizon rig and triggered the spill. Questions remain about the final total of the cleanup bill
and the damage liabilities and possible fines BP will face. "If chapter one of BP's corporate nightmare took place
largely under sea in the battle to plug the leak, the next
chapter in this odyssey is likely to play out in courtrooms and
law offices," IHS Energy analyst Andrew Neff wrote in a
briefing note. BP, which already agreed to a $20 billion escrow fund to
guarantee cover of economic damage claims, has said it would
sell about $30 billion in assets to address the costs related
to the spill, and this asset selling process has started. "More assets are expected to be up for grabs as BP shrinks
itself to steel the company for a vastly different future than
it envisioned back in April, when the firm was reportedly days
away from announcing a massive oil discovery in the Gulf of
Mexico," Neff added. FEARS OF LONG-TERM IMPACT Many Gulf Coast residents have seen their fishing and
tourism livelihoods devastated by the spill. They and some
scientists have expressed skepticism about the government's
assertion this week that around 75 percent of the estimated 4.9
million barrels of oil leaked by the well had either
evaporated, dispersed or otherwise been contained. Carol Browner, Obama's energy and climate change adviser,
on Friday defended the government declaration. "No one is trying to oversell or undersell anything," she
told a community forum in St. Petersburg, Florida, where local
business owners said even the threat of oil washing ashore had
been enough to dent their income. There was no actual oil
impact on the St. Petersburg part of the Florida coastline. BP was working to produce a Gulf Coast recovery masterplan
within six months and hoped to get support for it from federal,
state and local government, according to James Lee Witt, a
former head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and now
a crisis management consultant, who has been contracted by BP. Michael Hirshfield, chief scientist with the ocean
conservation advocacy group Oceana, said it could be years
before experts fully understood the spill's effects on the Gulf
of Mexico ecosystem, or on species like the Atlantic bluefin
tuna, which spawns in these waters. "It's like trying to prove a negative. You have to wait
longer for the absence of something," he said, as the group
prepared to embark on a two-month trip to assess long-term
impacts on coral, fish, sharks and other marine life.
