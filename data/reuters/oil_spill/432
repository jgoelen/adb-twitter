 (Adds Transocean results, liability estimate, updates stocks) By Anna Driver and Braden Reddall HOUSTON/SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Shares of Anadarko
(APC.N) and Transocean (RIGN.VX) (RIG.N), companies that may
face liability related to BP's (BP.L) (BP.N) Gulf of Mexico oil
spill, rallied on Wednesday after an effort to kill the
ruptured well showed promise. But weaker-than-expected results reported late Wednesday
by Transocean, owner of the rig that drilled the well, cut into
some of its 6.3 percent gain during regular trading in New
York. [ID:nN04270364] BP Plc on Tuesday claimed "a significant milestone" in
efforts to plug the leaking well for good as heavy drilling mud
pumped into the Gulf of Mexico well was stemming the flow of
crude. [ID:nLDE67310T] Shares of Anadarko Petroleum Corp, which owns a 25 percent
stake in the well, rose 4.3 percent, were also helped by
quarterly results that topped Wall Street expectations.
[ID:nN03184240] Switzerland-based Transocean said litigation filed over the
spill would hold up payment of its quarterly dividend, which
must be approved by local authorities under Swiss law. "The Swiss authorities have indicated to us that the review
process will take longer than customary in light of lawsuits
filed in the U.S. and served on the company in Switzerland,"
Transocean said in a statement. Transocean executives will discuss the results on a
conference call on Thursday, and Mike Breard, energy analyst at
Dallas-based Hodges Capital Management, said he would be
looking for some reassurance on the eventual dividend payout. Transocean also said in its quarterly filing with U.S.
securities regulators that it estimates its liability related
to the rig accident at about $80 million, based on probable
losses that can be reasonably estimated. Earlier on Wednesday, Cameron International Corp (CAM.N),
the original maker of the blow-out preventer that failed to
stop the well from rupturing, reported a higher-than-expected
profit. Still, its shares fell 1.7 percent. [IDn:nN04234384]. "We've all gained a measure of guarded hope this morning
that last night's 'static kill' operation is reported to have
been successful," Jim Hackett, Anadarko's chief executive, said
on a call to discuss the company's second-quarter earnings. Anadarko, with an ambitious deepwater exploration program
in the Gulf of Mexico, said the U.S. moratorium on drilling has
not hurt its oil and gas production this year. In fact, the
Houston company raised its output forecast for the year. Anadarko has also secured loan commitments of $6.5 billion
in part to cover any liability from the oil spill.
[ID:nN03184240]. Cameron said it was gearing up for customers to seek
manufacturer certification for their equipment due to tighter
regulations. "It's going to happen all over the world," Chief Executive
Jack Moore told analysts on a conference call. "We're getting
requests in every corner of the world from our customers to
support this, and so we have to ramp that up to meet it both
with personnel and with infrastructure." Cameron said its blow-out preventers were on about half of
all deepwater rigs around the world. Excluding items related to the Gulf disaster and other
one-time charges, Cameron earned 58 cents per share, beating
the 54 cents expected by analysts on average, according to
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Since the accident on April 20, which killed 11 workers and
sank a drilling rig, Anadarko's shares have fallen 25 percent,
Transocean shares have tumbled 41 percent and Cameron shares
have dropped 14 percent.
