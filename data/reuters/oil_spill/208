MIAMI Aug 10 (Reuters) - A tropical depression formed over
the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday on a track likely to take it near
BP Plc's (BP.L) massive oil spill site before it makes landfall
in Louisiana.

 The U.S. National Hurricane Center said the depression,
packing top sustained winds of 35 miles (55 km) per hour, was
located about 375 miles (600 km) southeast of the mouth of the
Mississippi River. As a precautionary measure, the approaching storm has
already prompted BP to delay final work on a relief well to
permanently kill the source of the world's worst offshore oil
spill by two to three days. Computer models forecast the tropical depression will move
northwest, crossing the spill site before making landfall in
southeast Louisiana on Thursday.
