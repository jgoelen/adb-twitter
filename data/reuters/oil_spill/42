  (Adds Commerce Secretary Locke, Interior Dept. details) By Kristen Hays and Anna Driver HOUSTON/NEW ORLEANS, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Technical issues on
Monday muddled the timing of BP (BP.L) (BP.N)'s planned final
kill of its blown-out Gulf of Mexico oil well as concerns
lingered over the environmental and health fallout from the
world's worst offshore oil spill. A relief well seen as the permanent solution for the
crippled deepwater Macondo shaft was on hold while engineers
studied the potential impact of pumping mud and cement into the
bottom of the now sealed well, the long-awaited "bottom kill." Worries that this move could damage the cement seal already
injected in from the top and force out residual crude trapped
in the well have obliged BP and the government to carry out
more tests and discuss different technical options. The studies have delayed the likely timeline for the well
being permanently killed until late August, although no oil has
leaked into Gulf waters since July 15, when BP placed a tight
provisional cap over the mile(1.6 km)-down wellhead. The top U.S. spill response official insisted a definitive
kill operation was still the goal. BP and government scientists
should decide in the next day or two how to go about it. "We need to have a stake in the heart of this well,"
retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen told reporters. Allen said he was keen to give the go ahead for the "bottom
kill", but did not want to incur any risks in the operation,
such as damaging the cement seal or driving out into the ocean
1,000 barrels of oil thought to be trapped in the well.&lt;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ For full spill coverage   link.reuters.com/hed87k Special report on new BP CEO Dudley      [ID:nN29102489] Graphic on relief well    link.reuters.com/xes52n Breakingviews                            [ID:nLDE6740LL] Political risk factbox on the U.S.       [ID:nN02255831] ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&gt; He said he could issue a directive for BP to proceed with
its relief well later this week, and the final "kill" could
come about 7 days after it was restarted. The U.S. government's science team was meeting to discuss
technical options for the planned kill operation. The first option would have BP place a mechanism over the
top of the existing wellhead capping stack that would help
relieve possible pressure. The second would have the company
replace the existing blowout preventer -- a giant stack of
valves -- with a new one with higher capabilities. FOCUS ON FOOD SAFETY, ENVIRONMENT U.S. President Barack Obama's administration, which has
been criticized for its handling of the catastrophic spill, is
seeking to reassure skeptical Gulf Coast residents and the
wider public that the worst of the emergency is over. For 87 days following the April 20 Deepwater Horizon rig
explosion that triggered the crude release, an estimated 4.9
million barrels of oil spewed into the Gulf, contaminating
wetlands, fishing grounds and beaches from Louisiana -- the
worst-impacted state -- to the Florida Panhandle. Obama says the biggest environmental cleanup in U.S.
history will not end until the last of the oil is gone. He has eaten Gulf Coast seafood and took his family to
Florida's Panhandle Coast at the weekend to demonstrate that
the region's beaches were clean and "open for business". Louisiana's white shrimp season opened on Monday, but
although boats put out to trawl for the prized seafood
delicacy, fishermen were worried about the oil spill impact on
their catch and the prices they could get. [ID:nN16262401]. More than a fifth of federal waters in the Gulf remain
closed due to fear of oil contaminating the seafood. As part of the official campaign to allay safety fears,
Commerce Secretary Gary Locke toured a seafood processing plant
in Lafitte, La., about 25 miles (40 km) south of New Orleans. "We need to let the American people know that the seafood
being harvested from the Gulf is safe to eat," Locke told
reporters. "A lot of testing is done before we open state and
federal waters to fishing," he added. The U.S. Interior Department said it would limit the
practice of allowing environmental waivers for deepwater oil
drilling projects and instead subject such drilling to close
analysis as it evaluates its review process. [ID:nN16259763] Allowing companies to skip the environmental review process
for specific drilling projects has come under intense scrutiny
because BP was granted waivers for its ill-fated Macondo well. HEALTH WORRIES The massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill has also triggered
human health concerns. Prior spills have shown that contact
with oil and chemicals can affect the lungs, kidneys, and
liver, and the mental strain can boost rates of anxiety,
depression and post traumatic stress for years afterwards. U.S. health experts said doctors in the Gulf region needed
to be alert to these effects. [ID:nN15226037]. BP announced in Houston it was providing $52 million to
federal and state health organizations to fund behavioral
health support programs across the Gulf Coast. "We appreciate
that there is a great deal of stress and anxiety across the
region," said Lamar McKay, president of BP America. The BP ships and teams working on the final well kill
operation may also need to keep an eye on the remnants of a
tropical depression which has looped back into Gulf waters. The U.S. National Hurricane Center was giving the system a
60 percent chance of redeveloping into a depression and
computer weather models project it will return inland over
Louisiana after passing by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill site
again, following a previous brush last week.
