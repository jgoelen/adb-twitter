  DULLES, VA, Aug 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
MapHook, Inc., a software applications developer, today announced it is
using its resources and location-based journal and social networking
application to help create awareness of small businesses impacted by the
oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The "Gulf Caravan," started by a group
of concerned citizens from St. Louis, will use MapHook to showcase their
journey as they caravan 300 miles August 9-13 along the Gulf Coast. The
mission of the Gulf Caravan is to raise awareness nationally about the
struggling businesses in the Gulf region and to provide hope by spending
money at local, small businesses along the route to help stimulate their
recovery efforts. The money spent originates from donations provided by
concerned citizens and communities from around the country. 

    "MapHook is pleased to support this important effort. In addition, Gulf
Caravan's use of our social networking application will help create more
awareness of how hard things are for small businesses in the Gulf right
now," said Paul Carter, CEO of MapHook. "From the start, caravan
participants will be creating 'Hooks' about their journey, including
showing the businesses they visit and detailing how people can donate and
get involved. Those using MapHook on their iPhone can follow the caravan
using the app, or anyone can go to MapHook.com, register for free and see
the progress the caravan is making." 

    "We are thrilled to have MapHook's support to boost up small businesses
that have been devastated by no fault of their own following the oil
spill in the Gulf," said Gulf Caravan organizer Dennis Gorg. "I can't
wait to create Hooks throughout the Gulf Coast caravan so people can
track our progress and hear about the experiences we are having and get
involved."

    Media are invited to accompany the caravan on its journey or meet it at
any stop on the route. Those who are unable to make the trip can
contribute funds to spend on their behalf via PayPal by visiting the
group's website at www.gulfcaravan.com.
