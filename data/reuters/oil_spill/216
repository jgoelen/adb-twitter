Aug 10 (Reuters) - The following were the top stories in
The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. Reuters has not verified
these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

 * A confidential, seven-page Google Inc GOOG "vision
statement" shows the information-age giant in a deep round of
soul-searching over a basic question: How far should it go in
profiting from its crown jewels -- the vast trove of data it
possesses about people's activities? * The Obama administration and BP PLC (BP.L) are close to a
deal to use future revenues from the oil giant's Gulf of Mexico
operations to guarantee its $20 billion cleanup and
compensation fund, a move that would give both sides an
incentive to continue production in the Gulf, scene of the
U.S.'s worst-ever offshore oil spill. * Google Inc GOOG and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N)
released a joint proposal stating that wireline broadband
providers shouldn't be able to discriminate against lawful
Internet content providers. But the plan would provide benefits
to both companies. * At least 36 of the 100-largest U.S. prime money-market
funds had to be propped up in order to survive the financial
crisis, according to a report from Moody's Investors Service. * Mark Hurd's exit from Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) caused
two different reactions Monday: H-P customers said they were
standing by the technology behemoth, even as the company's
shareholders fled the stock. * Personal incomes fell across the U.S. last year except in
areas with a high concentration of federal government and
military jobs, the Commerce Department said Monday. They
declined most in places with a lot of housing and finance jobs. * Two Indian fraternal tycoons, Ravi and Shashi Ruia, are
moving into the international spotlight as they strive to turn
their company into a global energy giant. Over the past few
decades, the Ruias have built Essar Group from a small
construction firm into an industrial force, with $15 billion in
annual revenue from steel, shipping and telecommunications. * More than 100 investors with convicted Ponzi schemer
Bernard Madoff's firm said they are entitled to a recovery
despite withdrawing more than they originally invested. * The Bank of Japan's policy board decided Tuesday to leave
its super-easy monetary policy unchanged, as the central bank
waits to assess the impact of the yen's recent strength on the
country's fragile economic recovery. * Lured by hefty yields, investors are pouring billions of
dollars into a small corner of the stock market --
energy-focused master limited partnerships -- which has seen a
huge rally of 15 percent this year. And that makes some people
nervous. * KKR &amp; Co (KKR.N) said it dropped plans to raise $500
million in a stock offering, a setback for the firm as it
begins life as a company publicly traded on the New York Stock
Exchange. * This holiday season, Sam's Club, the Wal-Mart Stores Inc
(WMT.N) membership warehouse chain, is making a big bet on
Internet-connected television sets -- and hopes that providing
free Wi-Fi in its stores will help draw customers to the new
technology.
