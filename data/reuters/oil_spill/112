   * TSX rises 4.65 points to 11,528.25

 * Rising banks help lift index * Ends week 2.3 percent lower By Claire Sibonney and Pav Jordan TORONTO, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Toronto's main stock index
edged higher on Friday as financial shares rose marginally, but
energy and mining stocks fell with skittish investors still
gauging the fate of the global economic recovery. The higher close barely snapped a three-day slide, with
fresh U.S. economic reports doing little to moderate fears that
came back to fore this week that the recovery could stall. "The market is very skittish, people are quite nervous,
there's a lot of volatility," said Irwin Michael, portfolio
manager at ABC Funds, noting volumes were thin on a summer
Friday. "This has been a very difficult week ... continuing
concerns about a double-dip recession and not a lot of
conviction out there, and the lower the market goes the more
people get negative. But our view is the market is oversold
here." The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&amp;P/TSX composite index
.GSPTSE closed up 4.65 points, or 0.04 percent, at 11,528.25.
The index was down 2.3 percent for the week. The rise followed the market's weakest close in three weeks
on Thursday, when the index fell 0.51 percent. The financial sector etched out a tenuous rise of 0.2
percent as Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) advanced 0.35 percent
to C$71.07 per share. Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS.TO) rose 0.99
percent to C$49.74 per share and the Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce (CM.TO) rose 0.15 percent to C$68.67 per share. Investors had mixed reactions to a report on U.S. retail
sales, which rebounded in July but showed hints of lingering
economic softness, as well as inflation data showing underlying
price pressures stuck at their lowest level since the 1960s.
[ID:nN13180040] Consumer sentiment appeared to have stabilized in August
but consumers saw little improvement in the economy ahead,
while business inventories rose more than analysts had been
expecting. Adding to investor nerves, a top U.S. Federal Reserve
official said the central bank is undertaking a "dangerous
gamble" by keeping rates at near zero for so long, and it must
start raising rates or risk damaging the nascent U.S. recovery.
[ID:nN13260474] The resource-loaded Toronto index was weighed down by the
hefty materials sector, off 0.49 percent, and the energy
sector, down 0.27 percent, as some commodity prices slid. Among the heavyweight decliners was Barrick Gold Corp
(ABX.TO), the world's largest gold company, which slid 0.62
percent to C$44.78 per share. Stock in Goldcorp Inc (G.TO) and
Agnico-Eagle (AEM.TO), both large Canadian gold producers, fell
1.55 percent and 0.4 percent respectively. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd (CNQ.TO), the country's
biggest independent oil explorer, fell 1.24 percent to C$33.47
as oil dropped for a fourth day. [O/R] BlackBerry maker Research In Motion (RIM.TO) also weighed
on the market. It fell another 1,51 percent on Friday to
C$55.59 per share despite a move to provide India with
technical solutions next week to help read its encrypted data
that New Delhi sees as a security threat. [ID:nSGE67C07Q] Stock in Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO) rose 0.91 percent to C$50.90
after the company said it has not been forced to ration oil
shipments on its North American pipeline system because of its
Michigan oil spill. [ID:nN12132779] Loblaw Cos (L.TO) added 1.02 percent to C$43.45 per share
after announcing it will close its Halifax distribution center
to reduce excess capacity in the Atlantic region.
