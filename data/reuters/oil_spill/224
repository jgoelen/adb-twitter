NEW YORK (Reuters) - A low pressure system over the southeast Gulf of Mexico strengthened overnight and now had a 50 percent chance of becoming a tropical depression over the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in a report Tuesday.

Computer weather models forecast the system will move northwest across the oil-rich Gulf over the next few days, crossing over the Horizon Deepwater spill site, before making landfall in southeast Louisiana.Separately, the NHC continued to follow a low pressure system in the central Atlantic about 825 miles northeast of the eastern Caribbean Islands with a high 70 percent chance of strengthening into a tropical depression over the next 48 hours.But the Atlantic system was expected to turn northeast long before reaching North America.(Reporting by Scott DiSavino; Editing by John Picinich)
