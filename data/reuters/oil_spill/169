 * BP had announced precautionary delay of well kill work * Remnants may still produce heavy rain over southeast US  (Adds quote, details) MIAMI, Aug 11 (Reuters) - A tropical depression which had been forecast to pass close to BP Plc (BP.L) (BP.N)'s oil spill site in the Gulf of Mexico dissipated on Wednesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. The Miami-based center said the remaining low pressure area, carrying top sustained winds of 30 miles per hour (45 km/hour), was located about 105 miles (170 km) east-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River. &quot;The tropical storm warning along the northern Gulf Coast has been discontinued,&quot; it added. As a precautionary measure before the approaching storm, BP had announced a delay of two to three days on its final work on a relief well to permanently kill the source of the world's worst offshore oil spill. [ID:nN10167101] The hurricane center said the remnants of the depression were still forecast to move ashore on the northern Gulf Coast in the next day or so, with potential to produce heavy rainfall over the southeast United States. The 2O10 Atlantic Hurricane season has seen only three tropical storms so far, with only one reaching hurricane strength. The season is nearing its traditionally most active phase, which runs from mid-August through October. Hurricanes feed on warm water and the tropical Atlantic is warmest at that time. U.S. government scientists last week reduced their forecast for the 2010 season, but said they were still predicting a very active year of eight to 12 hurricanes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said it now expected 14 to 20 tropical storms, with eight to 12 of those strengthening into hurricanes. It forecast four to six of them would become &quot;major&quot; hurricanes, ranked at Category 3 or above on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of intensity and with top winds of more than 110 mph (177 kph). Before the six-month season began on June 1, NOAA had forecast 14 to 23 tropical storms, with eight to 14 developing into hurricanes, and three to seven becoming major hurricanes. The revision reflected the lower than expected number of storms that developed in June and July.  (Reporting by Tom Brown; Editing by Pascal Fletcher and Jerry Norton)
