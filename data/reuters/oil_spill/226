HOUSTON Aug 10 (Reuters) - BP Plc's (BP.L) (BP.N) work on
its relief well in the Gulf of Mexico will be delayed two to
three days due to the threat of stormy weather, the
government's top official for the spill response said on
Tuesday.

 "There's going to be a delay of two to three days until the
weather passes," Retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen told a
media briefing. The drilling rig will remain at the spill site, Allen said.
