Aug 11 (Reuters) - The following were the top stories in
The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. Reuters has not verified
these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

 * Colorado Senator Michael Bennet survived a tough primary
fight to win his party's nomination Tuesday, bucking the
anti-incumbent tide that has been rumbling across the nation. * Containment-boom makers and their vendors that ramped up
supply for BP PLC (BP.L) after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill say
the company suddenly stopped accepting deliveries weeks ago,
leaving them with millions of dollars in unused product. * Hewlett-Packard Co's (HPQ.N) board got caught off guard
by the public relations campaign waged on behalf of its ousted
chief executive, Mark Hurd, to defend his reputation in the
wake of his departure. * Companies in the U.S. are stepping up purchases of
equipment and software at the fastest pace since the late
1990s. But much of the spending is aimed at replacing older
equipment after recession-related postponements or to improve
efficiency -- not to raise production or boost hiring. * General Motors Co [GM.UL] is expected to post its largest
profit in six years on Thursday, buoyed by stronger sales
around the globe and higher prices on cars and trucks sold in
the U.S * Five months into an investigation of safety issues
involving Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) vehicles, U.S. safety
officials have yet to identify any new defects beyond those
reported by the car maker itself. * U.S. energy companies are steaming about a disclosure
rule added at the last minute to the new financial regulation
law requiring companies to disclose their payments to foreign
governments. * New Jersey insurance regulators say they have concluded
Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N) properly handled
life-insurance benefits in a controversial matter involving a
solider killed in Afghanistan in 2008. * Google Inc (GOOG.O) faced fresh scrutiny of its privacy
practices Tuesday, with police in South Korea raiding the
Internet giant's offices there and German officials criticizing
the company's plan to roll out its mapping service in 20
cities. * Spyglass Entertainment is nearing a deal to run
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc once the beleaguered film studio
finishes restructuring a roughly $4 billion debt load later
this summer, said people familiar with the matter * Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) quarterly revenue and profit
surged thanks to a confluence of hit movies, blockbuster sports
events and an improving advertising climate, even as ongoing
softness in theme-park attendance pointed to uncertainty in the
broad economy. * The implementation of the sweeping financial overhaul got
off to a rocky start on Tuesday, when a series of top
regulators suggested Congress might have to make changes less
than three weeks after President Barack Obama signed the bill
into law.
