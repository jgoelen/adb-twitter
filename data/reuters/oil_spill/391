million, or 15 Canadian cents a share, compared with C$34.6
million, or 49 Canadian cents a share, a year ago. Revenue fell 25 percent to C$234.5 million. Analysts on average had expected the company to earn 26
Canadian cents a share, on revenue of C$262.8 million,
according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Backlog at quarter-end was up C$25.7 million at C$421.8
million. ShawCor shares, which have shed about 10 percent since the
BP (BP.N) (BP.L) oil spill late April, closed at C$27.06
Thursday on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
