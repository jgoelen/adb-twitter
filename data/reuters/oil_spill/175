HOUSTON Aug 11 (Reuters) - Apache Corp (APA.N) said on
Wednesday it has completed its $3.1 billion deal to buy BP
Plc's (BP.L) (BP.N) oil and gas operations in the Permian Basin
of West Texas and New Mexico.

 BP has said it plans to sell $30 billion in assets to help
pay for costs related to its ruptured well in the Gulf of
Mexico. The accident cost 11 workers their lives and created
the world's largest marine oil spill. Apache paid $3.1 billion for the Permian properties,
including a $1.5 billion deposit paid July 30 and the balance
paid on closing. Some of the properties are subject to certain preferential
rights. The effective date of the transaction was July 1, and
BP will continue to operate the properties on Apache's behalf
through Nov. 30, Houston-based Apache said. The Permian deal is part of Apache's previously announced
$7 billion agreement to buy all of BP's oil and gas assets in
Egypt's Western Desert and its exploration business in Canada.
