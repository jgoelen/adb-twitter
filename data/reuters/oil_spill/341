 * July payrolls data expected at 8:30 am EDT * BP's U.S. shares rise after finishes seal * Futures: S&amp;P up 2.6 pts, Dow off 4 pts, Nasdaq up 4.25 * For up-to-the-minute market news see [STXNEWS/US] NEW YORK, Aug 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were
little changed on Friday as investors awaited a key report on
the labor market to provide direction. * High unemployment remains a big hurdle to a sustainable
recovery, and investors are anxious to see improvement.
Conflicting reports through the week have battered sentiment,
with data showing private employers added more jobs than
expected last month, but initial claims for jobless benefits
unexpectedly rose last week. * Economists polled by Reuters expected the U.S. Labor
Department report, due at 8:30 a.m. EDT (12:30 GMT) to show a
drop of 65,000 in non-farm payrolls in July as temporary U.S.
Census Bureau jobs evaporated. Private employers are expected
to have added 90,000 jobs. For a preview, see [ID:nN05598486] * Stocks have been consolidating for most of the week after
rising 10 percent since early July. But if Friday's employment
data pushes the S&amp;P 500 to close above its June high, charts
show there's little to keep the benchmark from extending the
summer rally. * The S&amp;P has been closing in on its intraday June high of
about 1,131, which would open the door for a strong gain as
charts show little overhead resistance. * S&amp;P 500 futures SPc1 rose 2.6 points and were above
fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into
account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 dipped 4
points, and Nasdaq 100 futures NDc1 up 4.25 points. * U.S.-listed shares of BP Plc (BP.L)(BP.N) added 1.8
percent to $41.42 in premarket trading. BP finished pumping
cement into its ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico on
Thursday to seal off the source of the world's worst offshore
spill, paving the way to permanently plug the blow-out later
this month. [ID:nLDE6740LH] * Kraft Foods Inc (KFT.N) reported higher-than-expected
quarterly profit and raised its target for cost savings from
the acquisition of Cadbury. Its shares trading in Frankfurt
(KFT.F) were up 2 percent. [ID:nN05176007] * Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) could see interest after
it forecast current-quarter profit and revenue below Wall
Street targets, sending its shares down 6 percent after hours.
[ID:nN04105733] * Shares of U.S. grain companies could be in focus after
Russia halted grain exports. [ID:nSGE675064] * Stocks edged lower Thursday as an unexpected rise in
initial jobless claims and unimpressive July retail sales
bruised sentiment.
