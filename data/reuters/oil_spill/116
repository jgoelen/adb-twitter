HOUSTON (Reuters) - BP Plc and the U.S. government have agreed on the need to proceed with a relief well to kill the blown-out Macondo well, the top U.S. oil spill official said on Friday.

"Everybody is in agreement that we need to proceed with the relief well," retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen said. "The relief well will be finished. We will kill the well."
