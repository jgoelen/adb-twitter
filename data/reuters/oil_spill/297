 (Adds detail, CEO comment, analyst reaction, updates shares) LONDON, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Lloyd's of London insurer Catlin
(CGL.L) on Friday reported a steeper than expected slide in
first-half profit, hit by the BP (BP.L) oil spill, the Chilean
earthquake and currency fluctuations. Bermuda-based Catlin had a pretax profit of $86 million for
the first six months of 2010, down from $240 million a year
earlier, and below the $105 million pencilled in by analysts,
according to the company's calculation of consensus
expectations. Catlin shares were down 5.6 percent at 366 pence by 1220
GMT, making them the second-steepest faller in the FTSE 250
share index, which was 0.3 percent higher. Prior to Friday's
statement, the stock had risen 10 percent so far this year. "A disappointing result from Catlin," Shore Capital analyst
Eamonn Flanagan wrote in a note. "We remain disappointed at the lack of progress in the
rating environment." Catlin said it absorbed total losses of $1 billion in the
first half, an increase of 30 percent, driven mainly by the giant
earthquake that struck Chile in February. [ID:nCHILE] The company was hit by further claims relating to the BP oil
spill and by $49 million in foreign exchange losses, while its
investment returns fell 30 percent to $140 million as yields on
government bonds dropped. The property and casualty insurance industry is struggling
in the face of falling prices due to intense competition between
insurers holding abundant supplies of capital.     Chief Executive Stephen Catlin said that in the absence of a
major U.S. hurricane this summer, prices looked set to remain
broadly flat, denting insurers' financial performance. "The whole industry is suffering from a lack of investment
return, and if we're going to give the same return to
shareholders as we have historically, we're going to have to put
prices up on the underwriting side," he told Reuters. "But I don't think the market as a whole has woken up to
that yet."  However, Catlin said prices for energy-related insurance
had started to rise in response to the BP oil spill, while there
were signs also of an upturn in the aviation market. The Catlin CEO has previously said the spill will lead to a
surge in demand for liability insurance from big companies in
many industries. [ID:nLDE65S2B9]
