HOUSTON (Reuters) - BP Plc said on Thursday work has resumed work on a relief well next to its blown-out Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico after a tropical depression dissipated on Wednesday.

The company suspended drilling and put a plug in the relief well in advance of the storm. BP said it was removing the plug and would conduct a pressure test of the Macondo well before drilling resumes.(Reporting by Kristen Hays, editing by Vicki Allen)
