Evolving Practice, Job Market Projections and Boom in Demand Triggers Decision
to Expand to Online Classes 
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Beginning this fall, Golden Gate University, California`s fifth largest private
university and a non-profit institution, will offer its Forensic Accounting
Certificate completely online to broaden flexibility and access worldwide.
Students local to the San Francisco Bay Area will still have the option to
attend class in-person as well as online.

The course is primarily structured towards forensic accountants, accounting
professionals, and litigation attorneys looking to expand their forensic
accounting expertise and degree.

"The recent string of high profile corporate blunders and white-collar crimes
has certainly brought mainstream cache to forensic accounting, but the practice
is more diverse in its practical application," explains Mary Canning, dean of
the schools of accounting and taxation at GGU. "Assessing economic damages from
the BP oil spill is a more recent example, but the practice touches on
everything from marital and family law to financial claims, fraud, royalty
audits and more."

Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show that the accounting field is
expected to grow 22 percent between 2008 and 2018, resulting in more than
270,000 new jobs. Moreover, forensic accounting is identified as a specific
field for growth in the industry.

"The practice has been something accounting professionals have traditionally
`learned on the job,` but a trend we`re seeing from employers now is a desire
for more candidates with working knowledge of the practice and the skill-set to
meet the demand," says Canning.

The Forensics Accounting Certificate program at GGU debuted in Jan 2009 as part
of the School of Accounting`s curriculum and in response to a 2008 decision by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) which authorized
the specialty credential: the "certified financial forensic" (CFF). GGU`s
advisory board is comprised of top national subject-matter practitioners from
boutique and leading national forensic accounting firms that designed the
forensic accounting curriculum.

Fall registration is now open.Classes begin the week of August 29.

For 110 years, Golden Gate University has provided students the tools for
achieving their academic, professional, and personal goals with a new momentum.
