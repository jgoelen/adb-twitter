    On Monday, July 26, a 30-inch pipeline belonging to Enbridge Energy
Partners, L.P. ruptured in Marshall, Mich., releasing an estimated
819,000 gallons of crude oil into Talmadge Creek, a waterway that feeds
the Kalamazoo River. The spill has affected up to 25 miles of the
Kalamazoo River. The spill site, located between Marshall and Battle
Creek, includes marshlands, residential areas, farmland and businesses.

    The primary focus of the EPA and Unified Command is on clean-up at the
main leak site and along the shorelines of the Talmadge Creek and
Kalamazoo River.

    EPA has the role of Federal On-Scene Coordinator for this incident.

    Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. (www.enbridgepartners.com) owns and
operates a diversified portfolio of crude oil and natural gas
transportation systems in the United States. Its principal crude oil
system is the largest transporter of growing oil production from western
Canada. The system's deliveries to refining centers and connected
carriers in the United States account for approximately 12 per cent of
total U.S. oil imports; while deliveries to Ontario, Canada satisfy
approximately 60 per cent of refinery demand in that region. EEP's
natural gas gathering, treating, processing and transmission assets,
which are principally located onshore in the active U.S. Mid-Continent
