   * Oil spill panel asks for more details on safety reviews

* Panel co-chairs have questioned need for lengthy ban* Next panel meeting scheduled for end of AugustBy Ayesha RascoeWASHINGTON, Aug 9 (Reuters) - The White House oil spill
commission has asked the Interior Department to provide details
on whether any rigs covered by the agency's blanket deepwater
drilling ban are safe enough to resume operations.In a letter to Michael Bromwich, head of Interior's Bureau
of Ocean Energy Management, the panel asked for more
information about the safety reviews that have accompanied the
department's drilling moratorium."We are particularly interested in whether individual rigs,
or categories of rigs, subject to the moratorium are
sufficiently safe to allow the moratorium to be lifted with
respect to those rigs," the commission said in the letter
released on Monday.  The commission, charged with guiding the future of
offshore drilling in the aftermath of the BP Plc (BP.L) oil
spill, said it plans to weigh the effectiveness of implementing
a drilling moratorium following a spill as it makes its
recommendations.Interior halted deepwater drilling after a ruptured BP well
began spilling millions of gallons of oil into the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico.The department's moratorium has come under fire from the oil
industry and Gulf coast lawmakers, who argue it will cause long
lasting damage to the region's economy as offshore operators
move their idle rigs to foreign waters.The moratorium has forced companies like Royal Dutch Shell
(RDSa.L) and Petrobras (PETR4.SA) to postpone major projects
and affected rig contractors like Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc
(DO.N) and Transocean Ltd (RIG.N).After a federal judge struck down the department's initial
ban as too broad, Interior imposed a new ban through Nov. 30.The co-chairs of the seven-member commission, Bob Graham and
Bill Reilly, have questioned the need for a lengthy blanket ban
on drilling."How hard can it be to put inspectors on each of these
rigs... and simply draw some conclusions about safety
sufficient to allow some resumption of activity?" Reilly asked
at the commission's first public meeting last month.Bromwich has said the agency needs time to determine that
adequate safety, containment and response mechanisms are in
place before drilling resumes. He expressed hope last week that
the drilling moratorium could be lifted "significantly" ahead
of the November deadline. [ID:nN03185711] The panel said it may discuss the moratorium at its second
public meeting scheduled for August 25 in Washington D.C. (Editing by Sofina Mirza-Reid)
