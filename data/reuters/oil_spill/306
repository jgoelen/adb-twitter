hit by an offshore drilling moratorium in the wake of the BP
(BP.L) (BP.N) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, posted a
bigger-than-expected quarterly loss and warned of project
delays, sending its shares down 15 percent. ATP recorded a second-quarter cost of $8.7 million due to
the drilling halt in June at its MC 305 location, and said two
Telemark Hub wells and a drilling operation at its Gomez hub
have now been delayed. [ID:nN16151944] The offshore production company said all its additional
drilling and well operations in the zone have been deferred
until 2011. "ATP is seeking reimbursement of this, and other moratorium
related expenses from BP," the company said in a statement. For the second half, ATP sees a capital budget of $100-$140
million. In June it had said its original 2010 budget of $570
million was likely to be reduced by $50-$100 million.
[ID:nSGE6530FV] Experts have warned that new regulations and rising costs
stemming from the BP spill are expected to drive up drilling
costs in the U.S. Gulf, pushing many of the smaller oil and gas
producers out of the prolific energy zone. Echoing that, mid-cap oil and gas company Plains
Exploration (PXP.N) said on Thursday it plans to sell its
assets in the Gulf of Mexico and expand onshore.
[ID:nSGE6740J6] Shares of ATP, which have fallen more than 22 percent in
the last three months -- though they had jumped 62 percent in
the past two weeks -- fell to as low as $11.30 on Friday on
Nasdaq. For April-June, ATP recorded a net loss of $82.9 million,
or $1.63 a share, compared with a net loss of $4.4 million, or
12 cents a share, a year ago. Analysts on average had expected a loss of 19 cents,
according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ATP's oil and gas revenue rose 25 percent to $101.1
million, helped by a 24 percent rise in production, but lagged
estimates of $122.3 million. [ID:nASA00MJM]
