LONDON August 6 (Reuters) - Following is the view from Reuters editors in Europe, the Middle East and Africa on top news themes in the week beginning August 7.  RUSSIA - Impact of the wheat export ban EURO ZONE REBOUND - Second-quarter GDP data due RWANDA ELECTIONS - Kagame seen winner of Aug.9 poll ITALY - Berlusconi seeking show of confidence SANOFI/GENZYME - What's happening to the $18.4 bln deal? OIL SPILL - Finally, good news for BP? **Insider weekahead show: link.reuters.com/tap63n**  RUSSIA - Russia's PM Putin put the cat among the pigeons with a wide-ranging grain export ban from Aug 15 until Dec 31, in a bid to control inflation as crops wither in the worst drought on record. Putin's action, which effectively takes one of the world's top wheat exporters out of action for the rest of this year, has sent global grain markets into overdrive. While speculators anticipate a crisis on the scale of 2007/08 -- when wheat prices spiked and food inflation topped the agenda -- international bodies have said repeatedly the current rally on markets is overblown, given bulging stocks after two years of bumper harvests. We will be exploring the implications across all the asset classes: from the knock-on effect in stock, forex and commodities markets, to the impact on emerging economies, to which major companies and food producers could suffer and how consumers might be affected. We'll be looking at whether other countries are hoarding supplies and which of Russia's competitors will step into its shoes. We'll assess the political implications of Putin's ban, as well as his help for those who have been made homeless by the wildfires ravaging Russia, as he gears up for the 2012 presidential election. Insider is running a Russian wheat special -- see platform for details -- and is lining up an interview with the Egyptian trade minister early in the week and an interview with the chairman of the Russian Sugar Producers' Union on Monday.

Insider will have live analysis on Thursday of Greek GDP and on Friday of German and euro zone numbers. The zone's better-than-expected economic performance in the past couple of months has driven a clear easing of market fears about its debt problems -- some analysts now even predict Greece will hit its ambitious deficit reduction target for this year. However, economists still say Q2 may be the high-water mark for the European recovery, since government austerity measures will begin to kick in. Among European central banks, Norges Bank -- which late last year was the first European bank to raise rates after the global financial crisis -- is expected to leave its key rate at 2.0 percent on Wednesday. On the same day, the Bank of England will publish its quarterly inflation report, which should help to clarify why its policy makers have begun to countenance further easing. Insider will carry the news conference live.

Incumbent strongman Paul Kagame is expected to win the presidential poll handily as the opposition parties have not been able to register. The international community has praised Rwanda for its rapid recovery after the genocide, its stability and its bold vision to become a middle-income country by 2020. But Kagame is now under fire from rights groups and others for his authoritarian tendencies, and rifts within the ruling elite and regional insecurity threaten the investment climate. [ID:nLDE66Q1CD]   (Editor: Janet.McBride@thomsonreuters.com) ITALY - Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, his power sapped by a break with an ally, will seek a show of confidence from his splintered coalition in September and resign if he loses. Any sense of policy paralysis or loss of appetite for difficult policy decisions may be seized on by markets. [ID:nLDE66T21K]  (Editor: Janet.McBride@thomsonreuters.com)   SANOFI/GENZYME - Neither Sanofi nor Genzyme have said anything official about the French company's $69 per share opening bid for Genzyme, which makes drugs that treat rare diseases. Sources have told Reuters the two are in talks but it's far from certain that this $18.4 bln deal will be sealed. According to a Reuters poll of analysts and shareholders, Sanofi could win over Genzyme with a raised offer of around $78, or $20.8 billion, but some prominent Sanofi shareholders have told us they wouldn't be comfortable with much over $70. They will either split the difference or the deal will collapse, and clarity on the likelihood of either outcome will only come if the companies start communicating with investors. [ID:nN28227807]  (Editor: Chris.Wickham@thomsonreuters.com)   OIL SPILL - Good news for BP. The 'static kill' seems to be going well and, with Bob Dudley coming in as new CEO, Obama has softened his tone. The hole won't be properly plugged until the relief well does its job in the next week or two, weather permitting. We may see BP start to take a more robust approach to its partners' unwillingness to share the cost of the disaster. There is even an outside chance that Tony Hayward will move from vilified to vindicated. His &quot;it's a big ocean&quot; comment, which understandably caused so much offense, could be proved correct after reports that 75 pct of the spilled oil has been caught, collected or chemically dispersed. There could be further upside in the shares -- as long as BP avoids getting hit for gross negligence. The environmental impact of the disaster will remain in focus but political developments, namely whether a new energy bill can bar BP from drilling in the U.S., will be more important for the company.
