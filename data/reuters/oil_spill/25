 * Citi stake cut to 35 mln shares from 70 mln

 * Adds Palm, Spectrum Brands By Svea Herbst-Bayliss BOSTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Philip
Falcone slimmed his stock portfolio by eliminating at least a
dozen names and dramatically paring his top holding, a new
regulatory filing shows. The New York-based hedge fund manager, who is staking his
reputation on a big bet that he can build a high-speed wireless
network, eliminated stocks like Clearwire Corp (CLWR.O). and
Mercer International (MERC.O) in his Harbinger Capital Partners
Master Fund I. Falcone also pared back Citigroup (C.N), which had been his
biggest holding with 70 million shares in the first quarter,
and cut telecommunications company Sprint Nextel (S.N). At the end of the second quarter, the filing shows that he
owned only 35 million shares of Citi, which has been remaking
itself since being rescued with $45 billion in government
bailout money. He also reduced his stake in Sprint to 35
million shares from 49.6 million shares. During the quarter, Falcone owned 16 million shares of Palm
Inc, having first announced his purchase days before computer
maker HP agreed to buy the personal digital assistant
manufacturer. Falcone, whose strong returns last year helped earn him a
spot as one of the industry's best-paid managers, also added
25.8 million shares of Spectrum Brands (SPB.N), known for
selling everything from pet care products to small appliances
like the George Foreman grill. Recently he pledged 12.9 million of those shares as
collateral for a $400 million loan he raised with the help of
UBS. Cameron International (CAM.N), a manufacturer of oil and
gas pressure control equipment, including valves, wellheads,
controls, chokes, blowout preventers, also appeared in
Falcone's portfolio with 7 million shares. Many other hedge fund managers made bets on energy
companies whose shares had been depressed after BP's (BP.L)
Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Falcone has been one of the hedge fund industry's most
closely watched managers since a savvy bet in 2007 that the
U.S. housing market would collapse and that mining companies
would gain, earned his investors a 116 percent return. Since then, he has seen some ups and downs. His flagship
fund was off roughly 10 percent through the middle of July of
this year after having gained 46 percent in 2009. In 2008 he
posted a 22 percent loss. Money managers like Falcone who invest more than $100
million are required to file form 13-F within 45 days after the
end of each quarter. The forms include only U.S.-listed equity
securities and related derivatives. Bonds, other securities and
short positions are typically not disclosed. Managers may also
leave off U.S.-listed equities they own under certain
circumstances or file some holdings on confidential filings. For instance, in the case of Falcone, much of his funds'
more than $2 billion investment in a wireless telecom company
called LightSquared is not reflected in 13-F filings.
