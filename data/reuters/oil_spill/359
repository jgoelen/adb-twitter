 (Adds BP response, paragraphs 6-7, updates shares) By Braden Reddall SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Transocean Ltd (RIGN.VX)
(RIG.N) reassured investors on Thursday that BP Plc (BP.L)
would bear most of the liability linked to the Gulf of Mexico
well blow-out and resulting oil spill disaster. Shares of the world's largest offshore rig contractor rose
more than 8 percent, boosted by recent progress in capping the
well and despite some messy financial results from the latest
quarter released late on Wednesday. [ID:nN04270364] Although Transocean accepts responsibility for fluids that
came out above the water from its lost rig, its disclosure of
the Deepwater Horizon contract shored up market confidence that
BP would ultimately cover the rest. "In light of the facts, the law and the long history of
contract sanctity in our industry, we remain confident that BP
will ultimately honor its indemnity obligations," Transocean
Chief Executive Steven Newman said on a conference call. Analysts at Simmons &amp; Co said the disclosure of hundreds of
pages of the Deepwater Horizon contract did not add much to
what Transocean had said before, but "certainly does provide a
new depth of detail." BP responded by saying it did intend to honor its contract,
but rejected the idea that Transocean would not be liable
regardless of its conduct, which is still under investigation. "BP firmly believes that if Transocean's conduct is deemed
to be grossly negligent, then under the law Transocean would
not be entitled to indemnification," BP said in a statement. SHARES JUMP Transocean shares were up 8.4 percent at $58.07 late on
Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, trading at their best
level since late May. BP's New York-traded shares were up more
than 3 percent. Fears about its liability following the Deepwater Horizon
accident on April 20 knocked Transocean shares down as low as
$41.88 in June, but they have steadily recovered along with
progress in stopping the flow from the well. The U.S. government response to the disaster brought most
drilling to a halt in the Gulf of Mexico, where Transocean had
14 other deepwater rigs under contract. It said on Thursday it
was talking to two clients about moving their rigs elsewhere. Long-term deepwater pricing was already hit by a drilling
slump last year, and Terry Bonno, Transocean's vice president
of marketing, said near-term pressure on rates would persist
until there was clarity on the U.S. deepwater moratorium. "We are going to make it through this and it's going to
come back," she added, pointing to the much-improved oil price
as a spur to its clients to sign off on drilling plans. As an example, Transocean said Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the
second-largest U.S. oil company, had just extended its contract
for the Discoverer Deep Seas, an ultra-deepwater rig in the
Gulf of Mexico, for two more years at $450,000 per day. That is down from the previous day rate of $517,000,
running from March 2009 until February 2011, though that higher
rate was agreed in far healthier economic times. Transocean, based in Switzerland, said litigation filed
over the spill would hold up payment of its quarterly dividend,
which must be approved by local authorities under Swiss law. "I think the Swiss authorities are dealing with a situation
they've never really dealt with before," Newman said. "So
they're being very prudent and cautious and deliberative in how
they evaluate it. It is difficult for me to handicap the
risks." Like Transocean, smaller rivals reported weaker profits
last month, but they expected tighter regulations in the Gulf
of Mexico to create chances to buy more rigs. [ID:nN22273890] Newman said he would also be seeking out potential rig
acquisitions. "We continue to be on the lookout for
opportunities to grow the company," he said.
