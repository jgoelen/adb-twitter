 LONDON, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE index
is seen gaining on Tuesday, with mining stocks likely to be supported by steady
metals prices, as investors await UK inflation data.

 The UK blue chip index looks set to rise 19-21 points, or 0.4 percent,
according to financial bookmakers, after it closed up 0.66 points at 5,276.10 on
Monday.

 In the United States, investors found little reason to buy stocks on Monday
as the Dow .DJI and S&amp;P 500 .SPX also ended barely changed, suggesting that
even several days of losses have not convinced institutions that share prices
are attractive.

 In terms of domestic economic data, investors will scrutinise July's UK
consumer price index, due at 0830 GMT. The annual rate is forecast at 3.1
percent, down from 3.2 percent in June.

 Across the Atlantic, July's U.S. housing starts data and the U.S. producer
price index for July are both due at 1230 GMT.

 UK stocks to watch on Tuesday:
