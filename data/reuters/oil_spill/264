MIAMI Aug 9 (Reuters) - BP BP.&lt;L (BP.N)'s relief well is
closing in slowly on the below-seabed shaft of the blown-out
Gulf of Mexico oil well and is expected to intercept it and
commence the "bottom kill" operation before the end of this
week, the U.S. government's oil spill response chief said on
Monday.

 Retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen said authorities
were watching closely a weather system moving east over Florida
towards the Gulf of Mexico, which depending on its strength
might affect the timing of the "bottom kill" operation.
