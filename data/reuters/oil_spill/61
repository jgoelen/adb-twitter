 * Given 50 pct chance of becoming tropical cyclone

 * System is remnant of dissipated tropical depression
  (Updates with latest NHC report, quotes)MIAMI Aug 15 (Reuters) - An area of low pressure moving
over the Florida Panhandle was expected to track southward into
the northern Gulf of Mexico by early Monday and had a 50
percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone in the next 48
hours, the National Hurricane Center said on Sunday. The low pressure area was the remnant of Tropical
Depression Five which dissipated on Wednesday in the Gulf. The U.S. Gulf of Mexico is home to about 30 percent of U.S.
oil production, 11 percent of natural gas production, and more
than 43 percent of U.S. refinery capacity. "This system is moving southward ... and should gradually
turn southwestward and re-emerge over the northern Gulf of
Mexico early Monday morning where environmental conditions are
expected to be conducive for possible redevelopment into a
tropical depression," the Miami-based hurricane center said. It gave it a "medium chance", 50 percent, of becoming a
tropical cyclone again during the next 48 hours. The NHC said that regardless of whether it developed
further, the system would be capable of producing locally heavy
rainfall and strong gusty winds along the central Gulf Coast. Jeff Masters of private forecaster Weather Underground said
earlier long range radar showed a band of intense thunderstorms
had developed over the northern Gulf of Mexico. "The system may have enough time over water to become a
weak tropical storm before making landfall Tuesday night or
Wednesday morning over Southeast Louisiana," he added in a blog
posting on www.wunderground.com. Last week, as a precautionary measure due to the
approaching tropical depression before it dissipated, BP (BP.L)
(BP.N) had announced a delay of two to three days on its final
work on a relief well to permanently kill its blown-out Macondo
well, the source of the world's worst offshore oil spill. BP is now carrying out a last batch of tests of well
pressures ahead of an expected official government go-ahead to
finish the relief well. [ID:nN14527147] The 2O10 Atlantic Hurricane season has seen only three
tropical storms so far, with only one reaching hurricane
strength. The season is nearing its traditionally most active phase,
which runs from mid-August through October. Hurricanes feed on
warm water and the tropical Atlantic is warmest at that time.
