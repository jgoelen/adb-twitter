  OTTAWA, ONTARIO, Aug 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Wednesday's multi-million-dollar oil and gas lease sale in the Beaufort
Sea is imprudent, given that the National Energy Board (NEB), which
regulates petroleum development in the Arctic, has not begun its planned
public review of existing offshore regulations.

    The federal Department of Indian and Northern Affairs (INAC) announced
that Chevron Canada Ltd. paid $103.3 million for a deep site in the
Beaufort Sea, the result of a bidding process that closed July 6. Bids
were invited before the BP plc-leased Deepwater Horizon exploratory well
blew up off Louisiana's coast, resulting in unprecedented environmental
and economic disaster. 

    "We currently lack the capacity or technology to clean up spills in
remote, harsh conditions like the Beaufort," said Arlin Hackman, Vice
President and Chief Conservation Officer, WWF-Canada. "Awarding the deep
water lease in advance of both the investigative report on BP's spill in
the Gulf of Mexico and the NEB public review, near our disputed
international boundary with the US and without an overall plan for
conservation and development in the region, maximizes all types of risk
without any obvious benefit. This is a fault line in Canada's global
claim to Arctic stewardship." 

    "The NEB review must look at more than just how we drill; the review must
address the need to plan and sequence development to minimize
environmental impacts." said Rob Powell, Director of WWF-Canada's
Mackenzie River Basin program. "Awarding leases in areas that could prove
to be high conservation value zones could create unnecessary conflict in
the future, with the prospect of development in inappropriate places or
wasted investments by the companies." 

    WWF is a member of the Beaufort Sea Partnership, which is attempting to
develop plans to responsibly manage the Beaufort Sea. Canada's Oceans Act
mandates the development of integrated management plans and marine
protected area networks in all of Canada's oceans, though this has not
yet been completed in the Beaufort, or elsewhere in Canada's waters. The
Beaufort Sea Partnership, which is co-led by the Inuvialuit and the
federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), is working on a plan
that would reconcile development and conservation issues.
