 (Recasts; adds analyst comments, details, updates shares) By Thyagaraju Adinarayan BANGALORE, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Independent oil and gas
company Plains Exploration &amp; Production Co (PXP.N) plans to
sell its assets in the Gulf of Mexico and expand onshore, due
to the regulatory backlash over the BP (BP.L) oil spill. Industry experts have warned that new government
regulations and rising insurance costs in the wake of the
biggest ever U.S. offshore oil spill are expected to drive up
the expenses of drilling in the U.S. Gulf, pushing many of the
smaller oil and gas producers out of the prolific energy zone. Plains said its is targeting about $1 billion to $2 billion
via joint ventures and the sale of its assets in the region,
which represent about 30 percent of its potential reserves of
2.0 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Assets exiting the region are doing so at market lows,
Tudor Pickering analyst said in a morning note. The uncertainty around offshore drilling could make valuing
any assets in the Gulf of Mexico a tricky affair with a seller
possibly having to settle for discounted prices. "This is a buyers market," said Duane Grubert, an analyst
with Susquehanna Financial Group. "Possibly Plains will look at trimming down some of their
assets in McMoRan-partnered ultra deep gas program." Houston-based Plains' shallow water interests in the Gulf
of Mexico include the Blackbeard East, Davy Jones and Blueberry
Hill prospects operated by McMoRan Exploration Co (MMR.N). These assets could attract big players like Chevron (CVX.N)
and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), who have adjacent acreage in the play,
Grubert said. Another logical suitor could be Anadarko Petroleum (APC.N),
who partners with Plains Exploration in the Lucius project in
the Gulf of Mexico deepwater. Recently, Anadarko ceased
drilling operations at a well blaming the drilling moratorium. Plains Exploration has engaged Barclays Capital and
Jefferies &amp; Co to assist in this asset sale or joint venture
plan over the next few months. ONSHORE BECKONS Exploration and production companies have started shifting
their focus towards relatively safer onshore projects, in the
aftermath of the oil spill. The money raised from the Gulf of Mexico asset sales will
be invested in onshore operations, given the expected
improvement in gas prices, Chief Executive James Flores said in
a conference call. Natural gas prices NGc1 have risen nearly 20 percent
since the Macondo well blew out in April, backed by improving
demand. "We will reduce activity (in the Gulf of Mexico), drive
volumes both in the Granite wash, Haynesville and California,"
the company said. Currently Plains is operating 4 rigs drilling horizontal
wells in the Granite Wash development in Texas, and plans to
add an additional rig by the end of September. Plains Explorations, however, is not aiming to move
completely out of the region. "We hope to continue to be in the Gulf of Mexico in a
smaller form or fashion," Flores said. Shares of the company were up 4 percent at $25.46 in late
afternoon trade Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. STRONG Q2 RESULTS Second quarter net income rose to $45.4 million, or 32
cents a share, from $43.6 million, or 37 cents a share, last
year. Total revenue rose 31 percent to $364.6 million. Excluding certain items, the company earned 26 cents a
share. Analysts, on average, expected the company to post earnings
of 22 cents a share, excluding items, on revenue of $369.5
million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Average daily
sales volumes for the quarter were 85 thousand barrels of oil
equivalent (boe), higher than the 80.6 thousand boe last year.
Total production costs per boe fell 10 percent. The company also amended and restated its senior revolving
credit agreement, under which, the senior revolving credit
facility maturity extends to August 3, 2015, and increases its
borrowing base from $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion.
