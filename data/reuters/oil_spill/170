FRANKFURT (Reuters) - While buying a stock in a wind or solar company is an obvious investment in sustainability, artificial joint manufacturers, computer giants and truck makers may be just as green, a UBS fund manager told Reuters.

Bruno Bertocci manages the UBS Equity Fund Eco Performance, investing in companies that generate above-average social and economic performance and offer environmental benefits and high-resource efficiency."This doesn't necessarily mean all our investments are typically green," Bertocci said, explaining that Microsoft, for example -- one of the top holdings in his $200 million fund -- is a lot greener than widely assumed."Microsoft develops virtualization software to control energy use within a building," Bertocci said.The governance, manufacturing processes and healthcare provisions within the company, of which the consumer is often unaware, also legitimize the sustainable label his fund has given it, he explained.Other companies that feature in the fund's portfolio but are rarely associated with the consumer eco-boom, are Britain's Vodafone, Swedish truck maker Scania and U.S. medical device maker Zimmer.Vodafone, Bertocci explained, is active in bridging the digital divide by providing developing nations with a wireless internet network."The company is therefore acting sustainably, not in a typical ecological way, but in a humanitarian fashion," he said.Scania, he says, is ecologically innovative in its use of sugar cane to make ethanol to power trucks, while Zimmer makes artificial joints, valued for their ability to boost a patient's quality of life and offer high social comforts and benefits.SOLAR SCRUPLESWhile water stocks feature strongly in Bertocci's portfolio, solar stocks are not as widely represented."Until recently solar power was a fad which was valued too highly," Bertocci said, adding that the panels themselves are "simple to make" and it is therefore easy to enter the market and for a stock's price to dwindle with investors losing out.Now that prices of solar stocks have waned somewhat though, Bertocci said he may reconsider investing in the market.In April, ahead of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig catastrophe, the manager sold his stocks in BP because of their swelling price tag, and replaced them with shares in Royal Dutch Shell.The subsequent oil spill -- the largest offshore oil disaster in U.S. history -- gave rise to the question of whether investing in deep-water oil-drilling companies can be sustainable in any respect, but Bertocci is adamant that even oil companies have room in a sustainable and diversified fund."One of Shell's fortes is its ability to operate outside the box and develop in areas beyond drilling" he said."And if an oil company realizes that it can not be an oil company for ever, then we know it has a place in our portfolio."(Editing by Louise Heavens)
