 (Adds Paulson, Einhorn moves) By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Aaron Pressman BOSTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Top hedge fund managers went
bargain hunting in the oil patch in the second quarter, buying
shares whose prices had tumbled after BP's Gulf of Mexico well
disaster and in the face of lower oil prices. Top managers including Carl Icahn, Eric Mindich and Dinakar
Singh, whose stock picks are closely watched in investment
circles, added energy stocks to their holdings even as billions
of gallons of oil gushed into the Gulf, according to quarterly
securities reports filed on Monday. Others stocking up on energy shares included David Einhorn,
former Fidelity Investments star Jeff Vinik, the $22 billion
Boston-based fund Adage Capital and SAC Capital Advisors LP,
the hedge fund run by Steven Cohen. Fund managers must say what U.S. listed equities they own
within 45 days after the quarter ends. Energy stocks ranked among the worst performers during a
quarter that also featured the still unexplained stock market
"flash crash" on May 6 and new jitters about a double-dip
recession developing in the United States. Still, top fund managers staked out the sector much like
they did with financial companies earlier in the year. For investors bold enough to jump into the energy sector
while the Gulf oil spill was gushing and doubts swirled about
the future of U.S. offshore oil drilling, the payoff has been
swift and handsome. In particular, BP's  (BP.L) (BP.N) shares are up 28 percent
since the end of the second quarter, after losing roughly half
their value in the weeks that followed the explosion and
sinking of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in the Gulf
of Mexico in late April. After building his energy holdings slowly at the start of
the year, billionaire Carl Icahn picked up the pace, committing
nearly $1 billion to the sector during the quarter. &lt;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ For Insider segment on Icahn's holdings:

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&gt; Icahn also picked up shares of oil and gas producer
Anadarko Petroleum (APC.N) and offshore drilling specialist
Ensco Plc's (ESV.N) sponsored American Depository Receipts,
according to documents submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Monday. Other companies that attracted interest from one or more
hedge funds included drilling services specialist Baker Hughes
(BHI.N) and oil services company Halliburton (HAL.N). Mindich, whose skills at Goldman Sachs helped him raise a
record $3 billion when he started his fund in 2004, bought both
shares and call options in BP, and a variety of other
companies in the sector: Diamond Offshore Drilling (DO.N),
Forest Oil (FST.N), Marathon Oil (MRO.N), Plains Exploration &amp;
Production (PXP.N) and Suncor Energy (SU.TO). Einhorn's Greenlight Capital bought just over 5 percent of
Ensco's shares. In a letter to investors last month, Einhorn
said the Gulf oil spill "should not materially impact (Ensco's)
long-term potential." Einhorn's other actions centered mostly on technology,
where he boosted exposure to Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Xerox
Corp (XRX.N), and took a stake in Apple Inc (AAPL.O). The forms managers filed on Monday include only U.S.-listed
equity securities and related derivatives. Bonds, other
securities and short positions are typically not disclosed.
Managers may also omit U.S.-listed equities under certain
circumstances or file some holdings on confidential filings. Einhorn and John Paulson of the Paulson Funds were among
the managers taking larger stakes in drugmaker Pfizer Inc
(PFE.N). Paulson&gt; also raised a few eyebrows by picking up one
million shares of Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) in the second
quarter. Paulson's was the hedge fund at the heart of the SEC's
civil fraud case against the Wall Street bank. In April, the
SEC charged Goldman with failing to disclose that Paulson's
fund had a hand in picking securities for a complex
mortgage-related deal that the hedge fund was betting against. Regulators did not charge the fund with any wrongdoing, but
his investors became so nervous that he was forced to hold a
series of conference calls to explain the matter.
