NEW YORK Aug 11 (Reuters) - U.S. energy company UGI Corp
(UGI.N) on Wednesday said it agreed to buy BP Plc's (BP.L)
liquefied petroleum gas business in Denmark. Terms of the deal, including its value, were not disclosed.
The BP business distributes nearly 9.5 million gallons of
liquefied petroleum gas annually in Denmark. UGI said the business will be managed by its Flaga GmbH
subsidiary, which distributes the gas in Europe. British oil major BP is in the midst of a $25 billion to
$30 billion asset sales program to shore up its balance sheet
in the wake of its massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. UGI expects the deal to close in Spetember.
