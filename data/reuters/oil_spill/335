							(1) These 2010 notable loss event amounts are based on management's estimates following a review of the Company's potential exposure and discussions with certain clients and brokers. Given the magnitude and recent occurrence of these events, and other uncertainties inherent in loss estimation, meaningful uncertainty remains regarding losses from these events and the Company's actual ultimate net losses from these events may vary materially from these estimates. 
							 
							(2) Net of reinsurance but not net of reinstatement premiums. Reinstatement premiums were $3.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2010.

			Corporate segment results are comprised of executive and board expenses, internal and external audit expenses, interest and costs incurred in connection with the Company's senior notes and junior subordinated deferrable debentures and other costs relating to the Company as a whole.  General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2010 were $16.4 million compared to $5.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009, an increase of $11.3 million, or 220.8%.  Share compensation expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2010 was $3.6 million compared to $2.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009, an increase of $1.6 million, or 82.7%.  General and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2010 were $28.1 million compared to $9.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009, an increase of $18.9 million, or 206.0%.  Share compensation expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2010 were $7.0 million compared to $5.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009, an increase of $1.7 million, or 31.6%.  During the first quarter, to better align the Company's operating and reporting structure with its current strategy, there was a change in the segment structure. This change was to allocate all 'non-core underwriting' expenses, predominantly general and administration and stock compensation expenses to the Corporate segment which contributed to the increase. 
			 
			Investments
			Net investment income for the three months ended June 30, 2010 was $34.8 million compared to $27.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009, an increase of $7.8 million, or 29.1%.  Net investment income for the six months ended June 30, 2010 was $69.1 million compared to $53.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009, an increase of $15.4 million, or 28.6%.  Net investment income increased as a result of higher average investment balances slightly offset by reduced market yields. 
			Net realized gains on investments for the three months ended June 30, 2010 were $12.4 million compared to net realized (losses) of ($2.7) million for the three months ended June 30, 2009, an increase of $15.1 million, or 569.5%. Net realized gains on investments for the six months ended June 30, 2010 were $23.8 million compared to net realized (losses) of ($26.1) million for the six months ended June 30, 2009, an increase of $49.9 million, or 191.4%. 
			Net unrealized gains on investments for the three months ended June 30, 2010 were $41.6 million compared to $37.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009, an increase of $4.4 million, or 11.8%. Net unrealized gains on investments for the six months ended June 30, 2010 were $57.1 million compared to $59.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009, a decrease of $2.3 million, or 4.0%.  The net unrealized gains in the six months ended June 30, 2010 resulted primarily from lower market interest rates.  
			Finance Expenses
			Finance expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2010 were $13.2 million compared to $10.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009, an increase of $2.5 million, or 22.9%.  Finance expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2010 were $28.4 million compared to $18.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009, an increase of $9.9 million, or 53.6%.  This increase primarily related to the interest on the senior notes issued at the beginning of 2010. Finance expenses consisted principally of interest on the Company's senior notes, junior subordinated deferrable debentures and third-party capital costs for Talbot. 
			Shareholders' Equity and Capitalization
			As at June 30, 2010, shareholders' equity was $3.6 billion. Diluted book value per common share was $30.30 at June 30, 2010, compared to $28.66 at March 31, 2010. Diluted book value per common share is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of this measure to shareholders' equity is presented at the end of this release. 
			Total capitalization at June 30, 2010 was $4.1 billion, including $289.8 million of junior subordinated deferrable debentures and $246.8 million of senior notes.

							(2) As the average price per share repurchased during the periods 2009 and 2010 was lower than the book value per common share, the repurchase of shares increased the ending book value per share. 
							 
							(3) The estimated impact on diluted earnings per share was calculated by comparing reported results versus i) net income per share plus an estimate of lost net investment income on the cumulative share repurchases divided by ii) weighted average diluted shares outstanding excluding the weighted average impact of cumulative share repurchases. The impact of cumulative share repurchases was accretive to diluted earnings per share.

			Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
			This press release may include forward-looking statements, both with respect to the Company and its industry, that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Statements that include the words "expect," "intend," "plan," "believe," "project," "anticipate," "will," "may" and similar statements of a future or forward-looking nature identify forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements address matters that involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any such statements. We believe that these factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 1) unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events; 2) rating agency actions; 3) adequacy of Validus' risk management and loss limitation methods; 4) cyclicality of demand and pricing in the insurance and reinsurance markets; 5) Validus' limited operating history; 6) Validus' ability to implement its business strategy during "soft" as well as "hard" markets; 7) adequacy of Validus' loss reserves; 8) continued availability of capital and financing; 9) retention of key personnel; 10) competition; 11) potential loss of business from one or more major insurance or reinsurance brokers; 12) Validus' ability to implement, successfully and on a timely basis, complex infrastructure, distribution capabilities, systems, procedures and internal controls, and to develop accurate actuarial data to support the business and regulatory and reporting requirements; 13) general economic and market conditions (including inflation, volatility in the credit and capital markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates); 14) the integration of businesses Validus may acquire or new business ventures Validus may start; 15) the effect on Validus' investment portfolios of changing financial market conditions including inflation, interest rates, liquidity and other factors; 16) acts of terrorism or outbreak of war; and 17) availability of reinsurance and retrocessional coverage, as well as management's response to any of the aforementioned factors. 
			The foregoing review of important factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included herein and elsewhere, including the risk factors included in Validus' most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and other documents of the Company on file with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Any forward-looking statements made in this press release are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by Validus will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequences to, or effects on, Validus or its business or operations. Except as required by law, the parties undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. 
			Non-GAAP Financial Measures
			In presenting the Company's results, management has included and discussed certain schedules containing net operating income (loss), net operating income (loss) per share, underwriting income (loss), annualized net operating return on average equity and diluted book value per common share that are not calculated under standards or rules that comprise U.S. GAAP. Such measures are referred to as non-GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may be defined or calculated differently by other companies. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of net operating income to net income, the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, is presented in the section above entitled "Net Operating Income, Net Operating Income per share and Annualized Net Operating Return on Average Equity". A reconciliation of underwriting income to net income, the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, is presented in the "Consolidated Statements of Operations" above. Underwriting income indicates the performance of the Company's core underwriting function, excluding revenues and expenses. The Company believes the reporting of underwriting income enhances the understanding of our results by highlighting the underlying profitability of the Company's core insurance and reinsurance business. Underwriting profitability is influenced significantly by earned premium growth, adequacy of the Company's pricing and loss frequency and severity. Underwriting profitability over time is also influenced by the Company's underwriting discipline, which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, its management of claims, its use of reinsurance and its ability to manage its expense ratio, which it accomplishes through its management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses. The Company believes that underwriting income provides investors with a valuable measure of profitability derived from underwriting activities.
			 Annualized net operating return on average equity is presented in the section above entitled "Net Operating Income, Net Operating Income per share and Annualized Net Operating Return on Average Equity".  A reconciliation of diluted book value per share to book value per share, the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, is presented in the section above entitled "Diluted Book Value Per Share". Net operating income (loss) is calculated based on net income (loss) excluding net realized gains (losses), net unrealized gains (losses) on investments, gains (losses) arising from translation of non-US$ denominated balances and non-recurring items. Realized gains (losses) from the sale of investments are driven by the timing of the disposition of investments, not by our operating performance.  Gains (losses) arising from translation of non-US$ denominated balances are unrelated to our underlying business.
