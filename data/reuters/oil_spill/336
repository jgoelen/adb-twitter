 * U.S. July payrolls fall 131,000, more than expected * Kraft Foods shares up after quarterly results * Futures down: S&amp;P 9.2 pts, Dow 71 pts, Nasdaq 15.25 * For up-to-the-minute market news see [STXNEWS/US](Rewrites, adds details, quote) By Leah Schnurr NEW YORK, Aug 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set for a
lower open on Friday after data showed the economy shed far
more jobs than expected last month, exacerbating worries the
path to economic recovery would be rocky. Futures dropped sharply following the report and indicated
a decline of close to 1 percent at the open. Employment in July fell for a second straight month as more
temporary government census jobs ended. Private employment,
considered a better indicator of the health of the labor
market, also rose less than expected. For details, see
[ID:nN05598486] High unemployment remains a big hurdle to a sustainable
recovery, and investors are anxious to see stable job market.
Economic data lately has pointed to a more sluggish recovery
than expected, causing investors to second-guess the economic
outlook. "What this tells me is that we have a stagnant economy,"
said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at John Thomas
Financial in New York. "We're not creating jobs, and we should
be at this point." S&amp;P 500 futures SPc1 fell 9.2 points and were below fair
value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 dropped
71 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures NDc1 lost 15.25 points. S&amp;P futures found support at the 200-day moving average,
just under 1,113, piercing that level before bouncing back. If the S&amp;P 500, after the open, finds support at its
200-day moving average, that would be a decline of roughly 0.9
percent. A drop of 1 percent leads to 1,100 or 1,088 as the
next support levels. U.S.-listed shares of BP Plc (BP.L)(BP.N) added 1.7 percent
to $41.25 in premarket trading. BP finished pumping cement into
its ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday to seal
off the source of the world's worst offshore spill, paving the
way to permanently plug the blow-out later this month.
[ID:nLDE6740LH] Shares of U.S. grain companies and others in the
agriculture sector could be in focus after Russia halted grain
exports as the country grapples with its most severe drought on
record. Grain company Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N) was up
0.8 percent at $30.50. [ID:nSGE675064] Kraft Foods Inc (KFT.N) reported higher-than-expected
quarterly profit and raised its target for cost savings from
the acquisition of Cadbury. Its shares rose 1.6 percent to
$30.12. [ID:nN05176007] American International Group Inc's (AIG.N) shares rose 2.8
percent to $41 after the company reported quarterly results and
said it had started talks to exit from government help. AIG is
nearly 80 percent-owned by the U.S. government.
[ID:nN06184469] Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) shed 7.2 percent to $10.90
after it forecast its current-quarter profit and revenue to
come in below Wall Street's targets. [ID:nN04105733](Additional reporting by Ryan Vlastelica and Rodrigo Campos;
