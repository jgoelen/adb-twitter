DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
In a highly anticipated decision, the Judicial Panel on Multi-District
Litigation (MDL) decided that cases filed in the BP Gulf Oil Spill will be heard
in the Eastern District of New Orleans with District Judge Carl Barbier
presiding. 

"This is a great day for all those who are suffering as a result of this
catastrophe. We moved for the MDL to be located in the Eastern District of
Louisiana, the epicenter of the disaster, in front of Judge Barbier," said
Russell Budd http://baronandbudd.com/attorney_profiles/Russell_W_Budd, president
and managing shareholder of Dallas-based plaintiff law firm Baron & Budd, P.C. 

"Judge Barbier is a highly qualified and experienced jurist with the ability to
handle this complex litigation. He has been an active participant in the BP
litigation for months and has the docket with the most BP oil spill cases in the
country." 

BP and others moved to disqualify Judge Barbier prior to the MDL hearing in an
effort to recuse the judge and have the Southern District of Texas be a more
viable forum for the MDL. Baron & Budd assisted in drafting the briefs opposing
the attacks on Judge Barbier and BP's efforts were thwarted by the 5th Circuit. 

"Fortunately, the Panel was not persuaded by BP's efforts to move the litigation
to Houston and placed it in Louisiana. We're looking forward to representing the
interests of our clients in the MDL," Budd added. 

Cases to be heard range from injuries incurred during the rig explosion to loss
of income and property value due to the spill to illness caused by contact with
the oil dispersant. 

"Baron & Budd represents multiple clients, including various businesses, in BP
oil spill litigation
