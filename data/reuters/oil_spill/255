LONDON (Reuters) - Financial stocks boosted Britain's leading share index on Monday, rallying from falls in the previous session following weak U.S. jobs data and supported by energy markers which gained in tandem with crude.

The FTSE 100 .FTSE was up 78.13 points, or 1.5 percent, at 5,410.52, having closed 0.6 percent lower on Friday, albeit in light volumes, with the index having traded just 53 percent of its 90-day average volume."Stocks remain on historically low price earnings multiples, so any weakness presents a good buying opportunity particularly given the robustness of the recent corporate earnings season," said Jimmy Yates, head of equities at CMC Markets.The FTSE closed above the 5,400 level for the first time since May 13.Banks were favored among investors following their solid reporting season last week. Barclays (BARC.L) put on 3.2 percent, HSBC (HSBA.L) and Standard Chartered (STAN.L) added 1.4 and 1.5 percent respectively, while Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) rose 1.7 percent.Insurers were in demand with Prudential (PRU.L), set to unveil its first-half results on Thursday, up 2.7 percent.Legal &amp; General (LGEN.L), Old Mutual (OML.L) and Aviva (AV.L), which all reported results last week, rose 2.2-3.6 percent, boosted by price target hikes from Deutsche Bank, UBS and BofA Merrill Lynch respectively.Rebounding stock markets sharpened appetite for fund managers with Schroders (SDR.L), up 4.2 percent, also helped by BofA Merrill Lynch which lifted its target price after last week's first-half results.SPECULATORS EYE FED MOVELondon's blue chips were back on the front foot after reversing sharply on Friday, following worse than expected non farm payrolls from the Untied States which cast doubt over the sustainability of the economic recovery."We are seeing a lot of speculative buys on optimism that the Fed, when they start meeting tomorrow, will announce some extra stimulus measures to help maintain the U.S. recovery," said Joshua Raymond, market strategist at City Index.The latest Federal Reserve rate decision is due after the London market close on Tuesday, although no change is expected to U.S. monetary policy yet.Integrated oils were strong performers. The sector is bouncing back after weakness following BP's (BP.L) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and along with the price of crude, which rose above $80 a barrel.BP climbed 1.7 percent. The oil major said the cost of dealing with its ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico has risen to $6.1 billion, including $319 million in compensation payments to businesses and individuals affected by the spill.Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) was up 1.5 percent and BG Group (BG.L) gained 1.4 percent.Oil services firm Petrofac (PFC.L) rose 1.2 percent after it was awarded a $430 million contract by Kuwait Oil Company.International Power (IPR.L) advanced 3.7 percent. The British utility and French rival GDF Suez (GSZ.PA) could announce an agreement on a planned asset tie-up in coming days, British newspapers reported on Sunday, with both companies due to report first-half results on Tuesday.Travel firm TUI Travel (TT.L) was the top gainer on the FTSE, up 4.3 percent ahead of a third-quarter results on Tuesday.(Editing by David Cowell)
