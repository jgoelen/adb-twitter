HOUSTON Aug 12 (Reuters) - BP Plc (BP.L) (BP.N) said on
Thursday work has resumed work on a relief well next to its
blown-out Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico after a tropical
depression dissipated on Wednesday.

 The company suspended drilling and put a plug in the relief
well in advance of the storm. BP said it was removing the plug
and would conduct a pressure test of the Macondo well before
drilling resumes.
