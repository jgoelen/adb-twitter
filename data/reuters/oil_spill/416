 * 50 percent of BP oil "completely gone from the system"

 * Most of the rest rapidly degrading, NOAA chief says * Microscopic droplets still toxic to marine wildlife (Updates with NOAA's Lubchenco, environmental comment) By Deborah Zabarenko, Environment Correspondent WASHINGTON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Most oil from the BP (BP.L)
(BP.N) spill is gone from the Gulf of Mexico or has degraded
into tiny particles, with 26 percent remaining as a sheen or
tarballs, buried in sediment or washed ashore, U.S. scientists
said on Wednesday. "At least 50 percent of the oil that was released is now
completely gone from the system, and most of the remainder is
degrading rapidly or is being removed from the beaches," Jane
Lubchenco, administrator of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, told a White House briefing. A U.S. report released earlier in the day said 74 percent
of about 4.9 million barrels released since the April 20
blowout at BP's Deepwater Horizon rig can be accounted for: 25
percent was burned, skimmed or directly recovered from the
wellhead, 25 percent naturally evaporated or dissolved and 24
percent was dispersed, either naturally or with chemicals. Even that dispersed oil can leave tiny particles in the
water column between the sea floor and the surface, which pose
a potential hazard to wildlife, Lubchenco said. A final 26 percent of oil is considered "residual" and is
less easily categorized. Some is present as a light sheen on
the ocean or as tarballs, some may have already washed ashore
or been collected, some is buried in sand and sediment. Both the dispersed and residual oil, accounting for nearly
half the total, include oil that is in the process of
biodegrading. Until it has been totally broken down by natural
forces and bacteria into water and carbon dioxide, it still can
be dangerous, Lubchenco said. "Oil that is in microscopic droplets that is still there
may be toxic to any of the small creatures under the water that
are encountered," she said. "And even in very small droplets,
it ... can be toxic." "WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OIL?" The U.S. report, titled "BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Budget:
What Happened to the Oil?" found 33 percent of the oil was
dealt with by government and private cleanup efforts. This 33 percent consisted of 17 percent captured straight
from the wellhead, 5 percent by burning, 3 percent by skimming
and 8 percent by chemical dispersion. Some environmental experts were skeptical of the
government's presentation. "It's troubling that reports are lumping dispersed oil
still lurking under the water's surface with oil that's been
captured, contributing to the sense that the oil that's been
swept under the rug is no longer a problem," Dr. Bruce Stein of
the National Wildlife Federation said in a statement. "But scientific evidence shows this oil is far from gone,"
he said, citing signs of oil-and-dispersant mix under shells of
blue crab larvae, at the base of the Gulf food chain. The U.S. report was released just before officials from
NOAA and the Environmental Protection Agency testified at a
U.S. Senate hearing about the use of dispersant chemicals to
combat the BP spill. Paul Anastas, of EPA's office of research and development,
acknowledged there were "environmental tradeoffs" to consider
when using dispersants. Anastas told the Senate Environment and Public Works
Committee that dispersants were generally less toxic than oil,
cut the risk to shorelines and degraded quickly, in days or
weeks. Much is unknown about the impact of oil and dispersants on
the Gulf surface and deep down and study is needed now, Edward
Overton of Louisiana State University told the committee. "We certainly need to monitor for the long-term damage, how
long will it take species to come back," Overton said.    Jackie Savitz, a scientist at the marine conservation
organization Oceana, discounted short-term EPA studies showing
that most dispersant chemicals are less toxic than the oil. "It's a 48- or 96-hour study," Savitz told the panel. "Even
if all the dispersant goes away in that period of time and the
animal doesn't die, that doesn't mean that it's going to
survive and grow and flourish and be able to escape
predators."
