ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The U.S. Small Business Administration announced that it will open a Business
Recovery Center in Monroe County, Florida Monday, August 9 at 1 p.m. to help
small businesses and most private non-profit organizations affected by the
Deepwater BP Oil Spill that began on April 20, 2010. 

"Due to the amount of economic losses caused by the BP Oil Spill in Florida, we
want to make it convenient for affected small businesses to have a resource
where they can meet individually with SBA representatives and find out how a
low-interest disaster loan can help them recover," said Frank Skaggs, director
of SBA`s Disaster Field Operations Center East in Atlanta.
