WASHINGTON Aug 10 (Reuters) - Crude oil output in the Gulf
of Mexico should fall an average of 120,000 barrels per day
next year mostly due to the six- month drilling moratorium, the
top U.S. oil forecaster said on Tuesday.

 The government's moratorium which it put on exploration
rigs in response to the BP Plc (BP.L) oil spill disaster, ends
in November, but is expected to lead to drilling delays that
will carry over into next year. The moratorium will cut 82,000 bpd of output next year, the
Energy Information Administration forecast. Overall, U.S. oil
output is expected to rise 30,000 bpd in 2011 to 5.46 million
bpd, the EIA said. (Reporting by Timothy Gardner)
