NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tropical Depression Five moved northwest across the eastern Gulf of Mexico and was expected to hit eastern Louisiana as a tropical storm Thursday night after crossing near BP Plc's Deepwater Horizon massive oil spill site, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in a report Wednesday.

The depression was located about 185 miles south of Apalachicola, Florida. It was packing winds of 30 miles per hour.The NHC projected the system would strengthen into a tropical storm with winds of 39 to 73 mph within 24 hours but strike the Louisiana coast as a weak tropical storm.The computer weather models mostly agreed with the NHC forecast, though several projected the depression would make landfall in Mississippi instead of Louisiana.(Reporting by Scott DiSavino; Editing by John Picinich)
