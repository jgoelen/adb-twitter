NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings assigns an 'AAA' rating to the following state of Florida full
faith and credit state board of education public education capital outlay (PECO)
bonds: 

--$186,770,000 PECO refunding bonds, 2010 series A. 

The bonds are expected to sell competitively as soon as the week of Aug. 16,
2010, for bids on 18 hours notice. 

In addition, Fitch affirms the following ratings: 

--Approximately $14 billion in outstanding Florida full faith and credit bonds
at 'AAA'. 

The Rating Outlook is Negative. 

RATING RATIONALE:
--Sound financial management practices, including consensus revenue estimating
and management of reserves, are well ingrained.
--Long-term economic prospects are solid, although current economic performance
remains weak.
--Florida's revenue sources are vulnerable to declines in the rates of
population growth, consumption, and activity in the housing market, which
continues its severe correction following a historic run-up.
--The state's debt burden is moderate, and pensions are well funded. 

WHAT COULD TRIGGER A DOWNGRADE?
--Inability to maintain budget balance while preserving an adequate reserve
position.
--Economic performance weaker than what is assumed in current state forecasts. 

SECURITY:
The bonds are secured by a second lien on utility gross receipts taxes deposited
into the state public education fund, as well as Florida's full faith and
credit, the latter of which is the basis for the rating. 

CREDIT SUMMARY:
Florida's 'AAA' general obligation (GO) rating recognizes the state's strong
financial management practices, moderate debt burden, well-funded pension
system, solid long-term economic prospects, and still significant reserves,
including various trust funds. The Negative Outlook reflects the severity of the
state's economic and revenue decline as well as remaining uncertainty associated
with the economic and revenue outlook, despite some signs of stabilization. The
state has increased its revenue estimates modestly in recent forecast revisions,
most recently on Aug. 12, 2010, breaking a pattern of negative forecast
revisions in recent years, many of which were steep. 

Fiscal 2010 is reported to have ended with revenue growth of 2.4% compared to
fiscal 2009, reflecting significant revenue-raising actions in the fiscal 2010
enacted budget. This follows three straight years of significant revenue
declines, with revenues down 12.8% in fiscal 2009, 8.7% in fiscal 2008, and 2.5%
in fiscal 2007. The state does not expect revenues to regain their fiscal 2006
peak until fiscal 2014. Florida's revenue sources (primarily a sales tax, but
also a documentary stamp tax in large part based on real estate transactions)
have been especially susceptible to the decline in housing market activity. The
state has no personal income tax. 

The Florida legislature has consistently and promptly addressed the numerous
large negative revenue estimate revisions in the current downturn, maintaining
budget balance and an adequate reserve position. A large budget gap for fiscal
2010 was closed primarily through the use of federal stimulus monies and some
trust fund balances, spending reductions, and significant fee and tax increases
($1.9 billion, including about $850 million from a $1/pack cigarette tax
increase). But for those increases, the state has not relied on revenue measures
to close budget gaps. Total reserves at fiscal 2010 year-end are now reported at
$3.2 billion. Although sharply reduced from the peak of $9.9 billion in fiscal
2006, maintenance of this reserve position in such a strained financial
environment is notable and a key credit strength. 

The budget for fiscal 2011, which began on July 1, addressed a gap of about $2.8
billion with federal stimulus funds, reserve draws, spending control, and $433
million from a gaming compact with the Seminole Tribe that has been ratified.
The compact, the culmination of lengthy negotiations, will generate more than
$150 million per year in recurring revenue. Total reserves are estimated to fall
to a still solid $2.4 billion (more than 10% of net general revenue) before
including the benefit of the extension of federal stimulus funds related to the
Medicaid program (FMAP) that was approved last week. At the time of budget
adoption, a six-month FMAP stimulus extension was estimated to generate an
additional $970 million, but the legislature did contingency appropriations for
only $270 million. The August 2010 revenue forecast assumes fiscal 2011 revenue
growth of 6.7% compared to actual fiscal 2010 results. 

Florida's poor economic performance, one of the most negative among the states,
reflects the state's severe housing market correction. State employment was down
3.5% in 2008, compared to a 0.6% loss for the nation, and dropped another 6.1%
in 2009, much worse than the 4.3% loss for the U.S. The pace of decline in
nonfarm employment has been steadily dropping, however, and the decline of 0.4%
in June 2010, compared to June 2009, was the smallest year-over-year decline
since September 2007. 

Construction employment continues to drop (down 7.9%, year-over-year, in June);
June 2010 construction jobs of 366,100 compare to the June 2006 figure of
691,800. The state's unemployment rate, although down from a historical high of
12.3% in March 2010, was 120% of the U.S. rate at 11.4% in June 2010. As of its
July 2010 forecast, the state expects nonfarm employment to increase 1.1% in
fiscal 2011. Unemployment is projected to peak at 11.7% in fiscal 2011. 

Personal income performance has been weak, growing just 30% of the U.S. rate at
0.9% in 2008 and dropping 2.7% in 2009, a full percentage point worse than the
national experience for the year. Personal income is reported to have increased
1% in the first quarter of 2010. Based on the July 2010 estimate, the state
forecasts personal income up 3.7% in fiscal 2011. In 2009, Florida's personal
income per capita equaled 97% of that of the U.S. 

Fitch continues to monitor the impact on portions of the state from the oil
spill related to the April 20, 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig
in the Gulf of Mexico, though it is too early to discern the resulting economic
and budgetary impact at this time. The oil spill is not factored into the
state's current forecasts. 

Debt represents a moderate burden on Florida's resources. Net tax-supported debt
of about $22.4 billion equals 3.2% of personal income. Florida's debt portfolio
does not include derivatives and variable-rate debt is negligible at less than
0.5% of net tax-supported debt. Pensions had been overfunded since fiscal 1998,
but with market losses and the results of a 2009 experience study the funded
ratio dropped to a still solid 87% as of June 30, 2009. 

Florida's full faith and credit bonds are secured by specific revenues. PECO
bonds are the state's primary method to fund school construction. A second lien
on utility gross receipt taxes and Florida's full faith and credit secure the
PECO bonds now being issued. A closed first lien accounts for less than 1% of
debt service.
