NEW DELHI Aug 10 (Reuters) - India's Mumbai port will
resume normal operations by Sunday, Environment Minister Jairam
Ramesh told parliament on Tuesday.

 India's busiest port, was shut down after a weekend
collision of two cargo ships off Mumbai's coast, triggering an
oil spill and hurtling containers into the shipping channel. Ramesh said leakage of oil from the ships had been
contained.
