sample shipments are due to start, from mid-2011; clarifies that
regular shipments are due to begin in mid-2011. Clarifies in
paragraph 4 that the company aims to bring the plant to full

 (Adds details, background) By Yuko Inoue TOKYO, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd
(5405.T) said it would push back until the end of this year the
startup of its $1.6 billion pipe mill in Brazil, owned jointly
with France's Vallourec SA (VLLP.PA), with regular shipments due
to begin in mid-2011. The plant, which will have crude steel capacity of 1 million
tonnes a year, was to start up in the middle of 2010, making
600,000 tonnes of seamless pipes annually, according to Sumitomo,
Japan's biggest producer of pipes used in oil drilling. "We are slightly behind schedule, but aim to start sample
shipments by the end of this year," Saburo Eguchi, a senior
managing executive officer at the company, told Reuters in an
interview on Thursday. Eguchi said the company aims to bring the mill to full
production capacity in 2012. Sumitomo and Vallourec, which dominate about 40 percent of
the world's market for high-end tubes for the oil and gas
industry, each plans to sell half the pipes produced at the
plant. The seamless pipe market was in the doldrums in 2009, hit by
the global financial crisis, but has started to recover this year
on growing demand for oil. The number of rigs drilling for natural gas in the U.S. hit a
17-month high in the first week of August, rising by 11 to 983,
according to a report by oil services firm Baker Hughes, despite
lower natural gas prices and slower conventional gas drilling. Demand for higher-end seamless pipes is particularly strong
as unconventional drilling like horizontal drilling continues to
expand. Under the process, companies drill wells sideways to
reach specific pools of oil, which is beneath cities or
environmentally sensitive areas where a rig cannot be set up. In response to the BP (BP.L) oil spill disaster in the Gulf
of Mexico, the U.S. has introduced a six-month moratorium on
offshore drilling, but demand is strong in other parts of the
world, like the Middle East, China and India, Eguchi said. "The Middle East is becoming one of our biggest export
markets," said Eguchi, adding there is a surge in demand in Iraq
while Sumitomo's U.S. business is relatively small. Sumitomo last month raised its output outlook for seamless
pipes by 5 percent to 950,000 tonnes for the year to March 2011.
That is about 80 percent of its peak output level hit in 2006. Eguchi said the company was now focused on raising prices --
which had plunged last year in the aftermath of the economic
crisis -- rather than expanding production volume. Sumitomo Metal, which supplies its products to oil majors
like Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and BP,
aims to boost export prices of its seamless pipes by $300 per
tonne for the six months starting in October due to tightening
demand, Eguchi said.
