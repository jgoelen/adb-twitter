HOUSTON Aug 10 (Reuters) - Transocean Ltd (RIGN.VX) (RIG.N)
aims to move a rig and a drillship out of the path of a cluster of
thunderstorms in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, but neither are
involved with relief wells at BP Plc's (BP.L) (BP.N) oil spill
site.

 Transocean spokesman Guy Cantwell said the company also has
evacuated some workers from its moored Deepwater Nautilus rig.
