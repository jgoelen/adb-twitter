			WEST HYANNISPORT, Mass., Aug 11 /PRNewswire/ -- Cellect Plastics LLC (CELLECT) has received orders totaling $1 million from China Environmental Protection Fuel Group Ltd. (CEPFG) for its Opflex™ oil absorbing foam.  Opflex™ has been procured for immediate shipment to, and deployment in, the Dalian crude oil cleanup.  CEPFG placed the orders as a result of successful trials using the Opflex™ sorbent products in the Dalian Oil Port harbor, beaches, and surrounding coastline.  CELLECT's entire Opflex™ product line proved to be efficient and effective at removing crude oil in all of the environments where it was tested. Please see photos at http://opflex.wordpress.com/photo-galleries/.Scott Smith, owner and CEO of CELLECT, stated, "Cellect Plastics is honored to provide a technology that is part of an environmentally responsible global solution for oil pollution and oil spill cleanup.  I consider China my long term partner in setting new standards for environmentally responsible low carbon impact solutions for oil pollution and oil spill cleanup." The critical testing of Opflex™ was conducted under the direction of CEPFG and observed by local Dalian fishermen and citizens over two days, August 7th and August 8th.  Upon witnessing the performance of the Opflex™ products absorbing the crude oil in various locations, CEPFG approved Opflex™ for full scale use in the cleanup efforts. The two day testing and introduction of CELLECT to CEPFG was arranged by Glenn Wattley of West Bay Energy, LLC, based in Osterville, MA.  CEPFG Chairman Wenting Li said, "We now accept the use of Opflex in China just as BP America Inc. did in the Gulf of Mexico." The Opflex™ product line includes Opflex BOOM™, Opflex MOP™, Opflex SWEEPS™, Opflex MITTS™, and Opflex PADS™.  Mr. Smith and Mr. Wattley demonstrated the effectiveness of the Opflex™ products while working alongside local Dalian fishermen.  Mr. Smith may be the only person in the world to have personally participated, and received approvals for new materials for use, in the oil spill cleanup of both the Gulf of Mexico and Dalian, China. Opflex™ is an efficient, cost-effective, lightweight open celled foam than can be reused and biodegrades over time in a landfill environment.  Oil collected by Opflex™ products can be wrung out in a press or centrifuge.  Opflex™ is a true absorbent, meaning the foam absorbs the oil and holds it even in strong currents or rough waters, while conventional pom-poms and conventional sorbent booms tend to be adsorbents -- meaning only the outer surfaces are coated with oil.  Opflex BOOM™ and Opflex MOP™ products provide significantly more surface area than their conventional counterparts.  Opflex™ can be used in conjunction with other products and is not designed or intended to completely replace conventional products.
