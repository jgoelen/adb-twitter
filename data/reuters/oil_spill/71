NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn on Monday said he has added energy companies NRG Energy Inc (NRG.N) and Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) to his portfolio, and sold off most of his remaining shares of video retailer Blockbuster Inc (BLOKA.PK).

As of the end of June, his new energy and power holdings include 2.4 million shares of NRG Energy, 2 million shares of Anadarko and 240,000 shares of Ensco PLC's (ESV.N) sponsored American Depositary Receipt, according to a regulatory filing.At the end of last year, Icahn held no energy stocks, but earlier this year he took a stake in Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N). He raised his stake in that company by 15 percent to 12.74 million shares, as of June 30, according to the filing.Icahn has put about $923 million in energy stocks, according to a regulatory filing released last month, as the Gulf of Mexico oil spill depressed prices of many of those stocks.Icahn has been known for making aggressive moves to influence management at companies like Biogen Idec (BIIB.O), Genzyme Corp (GENZ.O) and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF.N).Icahn cut his stake in Blockbuster by 79.4 percent to just 0.68 million shares, down from 3.3 million shares in the previous quarter, as the company has been locked in negotiations with creditors to stay afloat.Icahn began unwinding his stake in Blockbuster after the video rental company said in March it may have to get bankruptcy protection to address a roughly $1 billion debt load. Icahn had given up his board seat on the company in January after serving as a director for more than four years.Large investors like Icahn must report their holdings of US listed securities at the end of each quarter, but not short positions or holdings of other securities such as bonds and over-the-counter derivatives contracts.To see a Reuters Insider segment on Icahn's holdings please click here: link.reuters.com/taq35n(Reporting by Emily Chasan.
