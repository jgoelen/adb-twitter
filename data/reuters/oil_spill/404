						(b)
						In the second quarter 2010, the company revised how it calculates global gross bookings and transactions to reduce these amounts for all cancellations made through its websites in order to more closely correspond with the way the company reports net revenue. Under this revised methodology, the company reduces global gross bookings and transactions for cancellations in the month the cancellation occurs, regardless of the booking date. Historically, these metrics were reduced for same-day cancellations only. The prior period data shown above has been updated to reflect this change. The company has also posted on its website (www.orbitz-ir.com) a schedule that updates historical gross bookings and transaction growth rates for this change.
						(c)
						Represents net revenue as a percentage of gross bookings.
						(d)
						Non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are contained in Appendix A.
						(e)
						Represents year over year transaction growth on a booked basis, net of all cancellations made through the company's websites.
						(f)
						Represents year over year growth in stayed hotel room nights. Includes both standalone hotel room nights and hotel room nights included in vacation packages. 
						Second Quarter 2010 Financial HighlightsFor the second quarter 2010, the company reported net income of $9.7 million or $0.09 per diluted share compared with net income of $10.3 million or $0.12 per diluted share for the second quarter 2009. Income before income taxes for the second quarter 2010 was up nine percent year over year. Adjusted EBITDA increased seven percent year over year to $48.1 million from $45.0 million for the second quarter 2009. Gross Bookings and Net RevenueGlobal gross bookings increased 17 percent (18 percent on a constant currency basis) year over year. This increase was due primarily to higher air fares and higher transaction volume. Air gross bookings increased 21 percent (22 percent on a constant currency basis) and non-air gross bookings increased seven percent (six percent on a constant currency basis) year over year. Domestic gross bookings increased 17 percent and international gross bookings increased 19 percent (20 percent on a constant currency basis) year over year.Net revenue was $193.5 million for the second quarter 2010, an increase of three percent (two percent on a constant currency basis) year over year. Domestic net revenue was up two percent while international net revenue increased eight percent (six percent on a constant currency basis) year over year. The growth in net revenue was due primarily to an increase in standalone hotel and international air transactions as well as higher travel insurance revenue. These increases were partially offset by lower airline hosting and advertising revenue.

						In the second quarter 2010, the company revised how it calculates global gross bookings and transactions to reduce these amounts for all cancellations made through its websites in order to more closely correspond with the way the company reports net revenue. Under this revised methodology, the company reduces global gross bookings and transactions for cancellations in the month the cancellation occurs, regardless of the booking date.

The company has also posted on its website (www.orbitz-ir.com) a schedule that updates historical gross bookings and transaction growth rates for this change.
						(b)
						Transactional net revenue is comprised of net revenue from air bookings, hotel bookings, vacation packages, car bookings, cruise bookings, destination services and travel insurance.
						(c)
						Non-transactional net revenue is primarily comprised of advertising and media revenue and airline hosting revenue.
						Air net revenue was $70.9 million in the second quarter 2010, up three percent on both a reported and constant currency basis year over year. Domestic air net revenue was up one percent year over year due to higher net revenue per airline ticket and a slight increase in air transactions. The company's air transaction growth rate slowed in the second quarter 2010 as the company passed the anniversary of removing booking fees on most flights. International air net revenue increased $1.6 million or ten percent (14 percent on a constant currency basis) year over year due primarily to higher air transactions partially offset by lower net revenue per airline ticket.Hotel net revenue was $52.1 million in the second quarter 2010, up 13 percent (nine percent on a constant currency basis) year over year. Hotel net revenue for the company's domestic brands increased due primarily to an increase in standalone hotel transactions. Hotel net revenue also increased due to another quarter of strong performance at ebookers driven by increases in both standalone hotel transactions and net revenue per hotel transaction. Net revenue at HotelClub declined due to lower volume in European destinations and a geographic mix shift towards hotel bookings in lower margin markets.  Vacation package net revenue decreased one percent in the quarter to $31.2 million due to lower domestic transactions primarily caused by higher package prices as a result of higher air fares and average daily rates for hotel rooms. Strong demand for packages at ebookers partially offset the decline in domestic vacation package net revenue.Advertising and media revenue decreased 13 percent year over year to $12.4 million, primarily due to a decline in revenue from membership discount programs. Effective March 31, 2010, the company ended the membership discount program previously offered on its domestic websites. Other net revenue, which primarily includes car rental, cruise, destination services, travel insurance and airline hosting revenue, decreased one percent (flat on a constant currency basis) year over year. This decrease was primarily due to the termination of one of the company's airline hosting agreements in the first quarter 2010. Higher travel insurance revenue due to higher attachment rates and higher air fares partially offset this decline.  In order to provide a more comparable view of the company's operating performance across periods, Appendix A to this press release adjusts gross bookings and net revenue for currency impacts. The company has also included a schedule of trended operating metrics in Appendix B to this press release. Operating ExpensesCost of revenueCost of revenue is primarily comprised of customer service costs, credit card processing fees and other costs including ticketing and fulfillment, customer refunds and charge-backs, affiliate commissions and connectivity and other processing costs.

						Cost of revenue increased to 19.3 percent of net revenue in the second quarter 2010 due to higher customer service staffing levels, higher customer service costs associated with the eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano and higher credit card processing costs related to stronger merchant hotel gross bookings. In the second quarter 2009, the company's customer service staffing levels were low relative to the sharply higher transaction volume the company experienced following last year's air booking fee removals. The company has since increased its staffing levels to better support the higher transaction volume. Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&amp;A)Selling, general and administrative expense is comprised of wages and benefits, contract labor costs, network communications, systems maintenance and equipment costs and other costs.

						SG&amp;A expense for the second quarter 2010 was flat year over year. Higher equity-based compensation expense, lower foreign currency gains and higher travel expenses were offset by lower costs for severance, employee incentive compensation, contract labor and systems maintenance and equipment.Marketing expenseThe company's marketing expense is primarily comprised of online marketing costs, such as search and banner advertising, and offline marketing costs, such as television, radio and print advertising.
				Marketing expense in the second quarter 2010 was $55.3 million, an increase of three percent year over year. This increase was primarily due to higher online marketing spending at ebookers. Marketing expense as a percentage of net revenue for the second quarter 2010 was relatively flat year over year.Interest Expense Orbitz Worldwide incurred net interest expense of $10.9 million in the second quarter 2010 compared with $14.6 million in the second quarter 2009. This year over year decline was due primarily to lower outstanding borrowings and a lower effective interest rate on the company's term loan. At June 30, 2010, $400.0 million of the $492.0 million outstanding on the company's term loan had fixed interest rates. The weighted average effective interest rate on the term loan was 4.85 percent at June 30, 2010, down from 6.04 percent at June 30, 2009.During the second quarter 2010, the company purchased and retired $14.0 million in principal amount of the term loan for approximately $13.5 million. Cash FlowOrbitz Worldwide reported operating cash flow of $114.7 million for the first half of 2010, an increase of 16 percent year over year. The increase in operating cash flow for the first half of 2010 was primarily driven by higher merchant gross bookings, improved marketing efficiency and lower interest payments, partially offset by lower booking fee revenue, changes in the timing of payments received from vendors and the payment of employee bonuses in the first quarter 2010. No bonus payment was made in the first half of 2009 based on 2008 results. At June 30, 2010, cash and cash equivalents were $144.5 million compared with cash and cash equivalents of $68.1 million at June 30, 2009 (net of $63.3 million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility). The year over year increase in cash is driven in part by the $50.0 million of cash proceeds received from the stock purchase made by Travelport in January 2010.Operational Highlights

						Appendix A: Non-GAAP Financial Measures
						EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAEBITDA is a performance measure used by management that is defined as net income or net loss plus: net interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as adjusted for certain non-cash and unusual or non-recurring items as described below. Orbitz Worldwide uses and believes investors and other external users of the company's financial statements benefit from the presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating its operating performance because:
			These measures provide greater insight into management decision making at Orbitz Worldwide as they are among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the operating performance of the company's business. Management believes that when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide additional information that is useful for management and other external users to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capability of the company's business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. These supplemental measures are used by management and the board of directors to evaluate the company's actual results against management's expectations. The compensation of management and other employees within the company is also tied to the company's actual performance, as measured by Adjusted EBITDA relative to performance targets established by the company's board of directors and its compensation committee.EBITDA measures performance apart from items such as interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Management believes that the exclusion of interest expense is necessary to evaluate the cash earnings capability of the business. The company generally only funds working capital requirements with borrowed funds (specifically, funds borrowed under its revolving credit facility) in the fourth quarter of the year when its cash balances are typically the lowest. As a result, nearly all of the company's interest expense is not incurred to fund its operating activities. In addition, excluding interest expense from the company's non-GAAP measures is consistent with the company's intent to disclose the ongoing cash earnings capability of the business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.  Management believes that the exclusion of non-cash depreciation and amortization is also necessary to evaluate the cash earnings capability of the business. Management believes that the review of its non-GAAP measures in conjunction with other GAAP metrics, such as capital expenditures, is more useful in understanding the company's business than the inclusion of depreciation and amortization expense in the non-GAAP measures used by management, since depreciation and amortization expense has historically fluctuated as a result of purchase accounting and this expense involves management judgment (e.g. estimated useful lives).Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the ongoing cash earnings capability of the company's business, by excluding the items described above, as well as certain other non-cash items, such as goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and stock-based compensation, and other unusual and non-recurring items, such as restructuring charges and litigation settlements. Adjusted EBITDA does not exclude certain non-cash items, such as accruals of revenue and expense, because these items represent timing differences and management believes that by including these items, it is providing a better view of the cash earnings capability of the business.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009, are not defined under GAAP and do not purport to be an alternative to net income or net loss as a measure of operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have certain limitations in that they do not take into account the impact of certain expenses to the company's income statement, such as stock-based compensation, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related accounting and certain one-time items, if applicable. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures used by other companies.The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA:

						(a)
						Represents a non-cash charge recorded in the first quarter 2010 for the impairment of an asset related to in-kind marketing and promotional support from Northwest Airlines under the Charter Associate Agreement. As a result of the completion of the operational merger of Northwest Airlines and Delta Airlines into a single operating carrier, Northwest Airlines was no longer obligated to provide the company with in-kind marketing and promotional support after June 1, 2010. Management adjusts for this item because it represents a significant non-cash operating expense that is not reflective of the cash earnings capability of the business.
						(b)
						Represents the non-cash charge recorded for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets during the first quarter 2009. Management adjusts for this item because it represents a significant non-cash operating expense that is not reflective of the cash earnings capability of the business.
						(c)
						Primarily represents non-cash stock compensation expense; also includes expense related to restricted cash awards granted prior to the company's initial public offering in July 2007 ("IPO"). Management adjusts for this item as it represents a significant non-cash operating expense that is not indicative of the cash earnings capability of the business.
						(d)
						Represents the net gain recorded upon extinguishment of portions of the company's term loan. Management adjusts for this item because it represents a significant non-recurring charge that is not indicative of the cash earnings capability of the business.  
						(e)
						Represents accounting and consulting services primarily associated with the IPO and post-IPO transition period. Management adjusted for these costs because they were non-recurring charges, representative of the company's transition to a public company.
						(f)
						Represents a change in estimate related to a restructuring charge recorded in the second half of 2009. Management adjusts for restructuring costs because they are non-recurring charges that are not indicative of the cash earnings capability of the business. 
						(g)
						Represents charges related to accruals established for certain legal proceedings. Management adjusts for these items because they represent significant non-recurring charges that are not indicative of the cash earnings capability of the business.
						Gross Bookings and Net Revenue, at Constant CurrencyThe Company's reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar.  As a result, reported financial results are impacted by the strength or weakness of the U.S. Dollar relative to the currencies of the international markets in which the Company operates particularly the Pound Sterling, Euro and Australian Dollar.  Management evaluates the Company's operating performance with and without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates because it believes excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates provides a more comparable view of the Company's operating performance across periods.  Management believes that when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, management and other external users are better able to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting operating performance.
