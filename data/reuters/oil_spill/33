			INTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT
			 
			Market Background
			The first half of 2010 marked confirmation that most global economies, including the UK, had emerged from 2009's deep recession. Corporate earnings and dividends generally exceeded expectations which helped to underpin equity valuations. This enabled markets to shake off a bout of nerves early in the New Year, sparking a rally that peaked in April.
			 
			At this point, sentiment began to turn sour, with concerns initially centring on inflation risks stemming from the strength in commodity prices (driven by rapid growth in emerging economies). In addition, it became clear that markets had lost confidence in the ability of some European countries (such as Greece) to control their budget deficits. This led to significant volatility in bond markets and worries that the resulting fiscal austerity plans would pitch the region, and possibly the world, back into recession. Questions began to be asked about the future of the Euro currency in its current form, raising the risk of a renewed bout of financial sector turbulence, given that the bonds of the Euro zone countries viewed as at risk are widely held by European banks.
			 
			As the second quarter ended, equity markets closed near their 2010 low points, amid concerns about a double-dip recession. Better news from company trading results and economic growth was being ignored. Pessimists would say this was due to the unsustainability of the recovery, putting earnings estimates at risk. Optimists would counter that valuations already discounted a mediocre outlook.
			 
			Investment Income
			There has been a recovery in dividend payouts this year, as recession-induced cuts dropped out of the picture and companies enjoyed a recovery in profitability. In the UK, overseas-sourced earnings were boosted by the strength of the dollar. An exception to this generally more optimistic picture was BP being forced to suspend its remaining quarterly dividends for 2010, as it grappled with the financial and political costs of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. This (even if only for one year) took nearly 10% from the UK market's dividend income for 2010. We were partly buffered from this by our underweighting of the UK market, and of BP within our UK portfolio, but it took the gloss off an underlying rise in income in the first half. In the event, our investment income fell by 2.5% in the first half.  Expenses were higher (although the total expense ratio fell - see the section headed Expenses below) and the VAT repayments received in 2009 were non-recurring. Accordingly, our revenue earnings per share fell by 11.0%. The underlying position (stripping out the effect of the VAT repayments received in 2009) was a decline of 3.0%.
			 
			Portfolio Changes
			Witan's new Chief Executive, Andrew Bell, joined in early February. He and the Board have been reviewing a number of enhancements to the management of the portfolio, against the background of improving relative performance, with the majority of the managers having outperformed so far during 2010.
			 
			Witan has had the ability to invest using equity index futures for a number of years but has done so infrequently. Nonetheless, the Board views this as a valuable source of flexibility in a multi-manager portfolio where medium-term stock decisions by the managers are a significant feature and where, as a result, changes in managers' investment allocations are an imperfect way of adjusting shorter term market exposure. The Company has used equity index futures since June, initiating investments in a number of regional indices to take advantage of the correction in markets by edging the gearing higher. These investments (with an underlying value of about 2.0% of assets at the period end) were mainly in UK and European indices, where the greatest relative value was seen. This ability, which operates within policy guidelines set by the Board, also enables Witan to adjust its asset allocation, in the event that stock-driven decisions by managers take the geographical asset allocation outside a desired range. 
			 
			Subsequent to the period end, Witan awarded a pan-European mandate to Marathon Asset Management, combining their existing UK-only mandate with Witan and the Europe ex-UK mandate previously managed by Wellington Management Company. The Board believes that the unconstrained ability to pick stocks across the wider pan-European index gives the manager additional scope to add value, as part of the Company's mix of national, regional and global managers.

			INTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT, continued
			 
			A number of direct investments have been made in quoted investment companies so as to gain exposure to special opportunities and undervalued assets in areas not covered by the outsourced managers. These areas include private equity (with investments in 3i Group and HarbourVest Global Private Equity) and distressed debt (via the NB Distressed Debt Investment Fund). The Board believes that the ability to take advantage of special situations, such as undervalued assets and areas too specialist to merit a formal segregated mandate, adds a further route for Witan to add value for shareholders.
			 
			Investment Performance
			The all round performance of the managers has been very good, with 11 out of the 13 managers outperforming relative to their individual benchmarks. In total, these 11 were responsible for management of over 80% of Witan's assets during the period. This fed through to a strong relative performance by the portfolio as a whole, although the negative trend of markets in the second quarter meant that this was not enough to deliver a positive absolute return in the period. The portfolio total return before costs was -1.2% in the first half of the year (2.8% ahead of the benchmark).  Witan's net asset value total return after costs was -1.9%, beating the -3.8% total return of the benchmark by 1.9%. 
			 
			The two laggards were Wellington in Europe, after a strong performance in 2009, and Comgest in Asia, whose fundamental value based approach delivered a positive return of 3.4% but lagged the 5.2% return from its Asian benchmark.
			 
			The UK managers all beat their benchmarks, with the smaller companies mandate managed by Henderson producing a 6.6% total return (for a 5.3% relative return) and the two more active mainstream UK managers also performing strongly, Artemis being 3.7% ahead of its benchmark and Marathon 2.8% ahead. Internationally, Southeastern continued its strong run from 2009, beating its global benchmark by 4.8%. Varenne's concentrated portfolio of pan-European equities performed outstandingly, with a total return of 8.4% in a period when its benchmark delivered minus 9.6%. Japan was also a bright spot, where Brandes delivered a total return of 9.6%, 4% ahead of the Japanese benchmark.
			 
			Expenses
			The expenses rose in the first half of the year, owing to the effect of investment consultancy fees, higher asset values, the costs associated with the migration of the savings plans to an improved platform and, most important, the non-recurring nature of the VAT refunds received in 2009. Basic investment management fees rose by 43%, owing both to the effect of rising markets and the decline in sterling. Performance fees (at £1.0 million) were lower than in the first half of 2009 (£2.2 million) but higher than those incurred in the second half of 2009 (£0.4 million). Aside from the level of performance, the figures are affected by fluctuations between parts of the portfolio with differing fee structures. The total expense ratio ("TER") for the six months was 0.51%, compared with 0.62% for the first half of 2009. Without performance fees, the TERs were 0.41% for 2010 and 0.37% for 2009.
			 
			Gearing
			The Company has structural borrowings of about £110 million, amounting to about 11% of net assets. In order to have liquidity for normal corporate expenses and to fund share buy-backs, Witan has typically held corporate cash balances, which (together with any balances held by the managers) has capped the Company's ability to gear at 6% to 7% of assets. There is also a currency difference between the investments (which are substantially non-sterling) and the borrowings (which are all in sterling). Whilst this has worked to the Company's advantage when sterling has been weak, as in recent years, this may not always be so.  The use of futures enables the Company to manage its gearing and asset allocation more flexibly. 
			 
			The gearing rose from 5% at 31 December 2009 to 8.8% at the end of June (taking account of index futures investments), as advantage was taken of the market correction to raise equity exposure towards the end of the half year period.

			INTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT, continued
			 
			Dividend
			The Company has a 35 year record of dividend increases, including last year when dividend income was under greater pressure than in living memory. The Board believes that the underlying trend of corporate payouts is turning positive (despite the special situation of BP) and has decided to increase the first interim dividend for 2010 by 2.3% to 4.4p per ordinary share. This dividend will be paid on 17 September 2010 to holders on the register on 27 August 2010.
			 
			The revenue earnings per share (6.32p) in the first half more than cover the interim dividend proposed. Although there is a possibility that (with the setback from BP) the 2010 revenue profits per share will be lower than last year's 10.63p, the Company has revenue reserves to smooth such events. The Board currently expects that any drawdown on the accumulated revenue reserves (of £44.7 million after the dividend payment in September - equivalent to about 23p per share) would be modest. Its policy remains to grow the divided at least in line with inflation over time, subject to market circumstances.
			 
			Share Buy-backs
			The Company has continued with its established policy of repurchasing shares at a discount, to reduce discount volatility and to be accretive to the net asset value per share. During the period, 3% of the shares were purchased for cancellation, adding 1.8p (approximately 0.36%) to the net asset value per share.  Despite this, during the period of global market turbulence and investors selling ahead of expected taxation changes in the UK budget, the discount widened to 11.6% (calculated excluding income and with the debt at fair value) at the period end.  During July and August, the discount has steadily improved (to 9.9% as at 13 August 2010).
			 
			Jump Savings/Wealthbuilder
			The Witan savings plans have seen increased inflows this year, although there have also been more withdrawals than during the depressed period for markets in early 2009. The Coalition Government's decision to stop providing funding for new Child Trust Fund accounts cuts off one route for families to save for children but the Jump savings scheme remains open for both new and existing investors. In addition, existing Child Trust Fund savers within the Jump CTF scheme will be able to add to their investment (within the statutory limits). Witan Investment Services Limited is moving the administration of the schemes to a new platform, to introduce enhancements for savers, and will be in contact with investors shortly to set out the details.
			 
			Outlook
			The equity markets' recovery in 2009 was fuelled by increasing confidence that the concerted stimulus measures adopted by global governments would spur an economic upturn. Although this has come to pass, the first half of 2010 has seen sharply fluctuating investor sentiment, in response to monetary tightening measures by faster growing economies, such as China, and fiscal tightening by slower growing regions, such as Europe. It is common for the transition from markets driven by interest rate cuts to those dependent on earnings recovery to be awkward and prone to worries that the previous source of fuel will run out before the new one becomes available. These worries are more acute because the debt overhang continues to erode private sector confidence, while national budget deficits constrain governments' ability to support growth. This has given rise to anxiety in some quarters that the world is doomed to slip back into recession, although these fears are probably exaggerated. With the global authorities having been given a severe fright by the volatility in European government debt markets, policy makers face a tricky balance between maintaining credibility with the bond markets and keeping policy sufficiently growth friendly to enable the debt overhang to be worked off in an orderly way. 
			 
			During July, optimism on corporate earnings began to outweigh worries about renewed recession, spurring a global equity rally.  Despite this, sentiment remains fragile and the outlook for equity markets, in the short term at least, is continued volatility.  Accordingly, Witan's managers will continue to concentrate on choosing investments whose prospects are not solely dependent on the external environment while the Board will determine asset allocation and use gearing to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves, while being mindful of the risks.
