 * Deal at 21 pct premium to Superior Well's Friday close * Deal to add to Nabors' results in 2011 * Superior Well posts surprise Q2 profit Aug 9 (Reuters) - Nabors Industries Ltd (NBR.N), the
world's largest land-rig contractor, agreed to buy oilfield
services company Superior Well Services Inc (SWSI.O) for about
$900 million in cash to enhance its technical pumping and
down-hole surveying services. Nabors offered to buy Superior Well, the top independent
player in the pressure pumping business, for $22.12 a share --
a premium of about 21 percent to Superior Well's Friday close
of $18.23 on Nasdaq. "Superior Well Services' broad U.S. presence complements
that of both our U.S. land drilling and well-servicing
operations and augments our expansion into areas such as the
Marcellus shale region," Gene Isenberg, chief executive of
Nabors, said in a statement. The Marcellus shale is one of the top unconventional gas
producing regions in the continental United States, attracting
parties as diverse as international oil and gas companies to
private-equity firms like KKR. Indiana, Pennsylvania-based Superior Well provides well
services to oil and gas companies in many of the major oil and
natural gas producing regions of the United States. Holders of about 34 percent of Superior Well's outstanding
stock have agreed to tender their shares to Nabors, which
expects the deal to add significantly to its 2011 results. The
acquisition is expected to close by the end of the third
quarter, the companies said in a statement. On July 28, Nabors had announced plans to use the $2
billion it wants to raise from asset sales in the next year to
buy other assets or pay back debt. [ID:nN28214733] Analysts have been citing Superior Well, Superior Energy
Services (SPN.N) and Parker Drilling Co (PKD.N) as possible
acquisition targets as cash-rich large oilfield service
companies set their sights on niche players to help them move
deeper into new markets around the globe. [ID:nSGE63D0AC] Ever since the BP (BP.L) (BP.N) oil spill, which has
hammered the shares of offshore companies, onshore-focused
companies' stocks have risen, with Superior Well seeing a 35
percent jump. The oil spill is also expected to spur drilling in shale
hotspots like the Marcellus, Eagle Ford and the oil-rich
Bakken, as companies and investors get increasingly wary of the
risks and difficulties associated with hunting for oil miles
away from the shore. [ID:nSGE65M0FS] Meanwhile, Superior Well posted a second-quarter profit of
$6.1 million, or 18 cents a share, compared with a net loss of
$37.0 million, or $1.66 a share, a year ago. [ID:nASA00MOU] Analysts, on an average, had expected the company to post a
loss of 10 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue nearly doubled to $176 million, way ahead of
estimates of $142.7 million. Shares of Superior Well were up 20 percent before the bell
at $21.93 Monday morning. Nabors stock had closed at $17.98
Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.
