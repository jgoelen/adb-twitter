of Mexico well and those results are under review by government
scientists and the British oil company. A recommendation on how to proceed is expected to to go to
the U.S. government, BP said in a brief news release. BP may not need a nearly completed relief well to drill
into the bottom of the ruptured Gulf of Mexico well if the
pressure test shows that cement poured in from the top last
week killed the leak, the top official overseeing the
government's spill response said on Thursday. [ID:nN12108187]. The test could indicate BP already cleared the last hurdle
to terminate the source of the world's worst offshore oil
spill, retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen told reporters at
a briefing on Thursday. No oil has leaked into the Gulf of Mexico since July 15,
when BP plugged the top of the well with cement. Shares of BP traded in London rose 1.2 percent while the
stock rose nearly 1 percent in New York trading.
