 * Milling wheat futures in Paris lower, extending Friday's
sharp pullback and tracking fresh losses for Chicago wheat, as
operators continue to claim profits after drought-hit Russia
said it would review its grain export ban in October.

 * Uncertainty over the situation in Russia and the
consequences of its ban was helping underpin the market and keep
benchmark prices above the key 200-euro threshold.

 * Russia will review its ban on grain exports after the
harvest and remains committed to its long-term obligations,
First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said on Friday.

 * SovEcon agricultural analysts said in a note on Monday
that the Russian government may extend its ban on grain exports
beyond the initially planned expiry date of Dec. 31, as its
wheat balance becomes very tight. [ID:nLDE6780TG]

 * Operators were also cautious as they awaited Thursday's
world supply and demand report from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.

 * Paris futures drew some support from news that Egypt
bought 240,000 tonnes of French wheat in a weekend tender, in a
first sign of European grain benefiting from Russia's export
freeze. [ID:nLDE67606A]

 * "You can see that we're competitive, that is going to give
the market a bit of support," one dealer said of the Egyptian
tender. "If the market were to break the 200 euro level it would
be a different story."

 * Benchmark November milling wheat BL2X0 on Euronext was
down 3.50 euros at 206.00 euros a tonne by 1220 GMT, after
falling as low as 203.00 euros in opening deals to approach
major psychological support at 200 euros.

 * Egypt's decision not to consider any Black Sea origins in
its latest tender reinforced concerns that Russia's export ban
will spill over into trade from Ukraine and Kazakhstan.

 * A broader squeeze on Black Sea shipments was also
suggested by law firm Holam Fenwick Willan, which told Reuters
some clients had received cancellation notices on contracts for
Ukrainian and Kazakh grain. [ID:nLDE6780T3]

 * Feed wheat futures in London were lower, weighed by losses
in both Paris and Chicago, with the market slightly more subdued
after wild price swings late last week.

 * November feed wheat LWBX0 were off 2.00 pounds or 1.3
percent at 150.00 pounds a tonne. The contract had peaked at
169.00 pounds on Thursday, the highest level for the front month
since April 2008.
* Dealers said there was further selling in Chicago wheat
after prices ended locked the limit down on Friday, which
sparked weakness in European markets. 

 * "We had a manic end of the week last week. It has got a
bit of a quieter feel to it at the moment," one dealer said.

 * Dealers noted the UK wheat harvest was slowly gathering
pace despite showers in some areas over the weekend while the
barley harvest is winding down in most regions.

 * German wheat prices fell following the drop in Paris and
weakness in U.S. futures while Spanish prices were steady,
though price levels were difficult to assess in the volatile
market, traders said.

 * Standard new crop bread quality wheat for September
delivery in Hamburg was quoted in a wide range but was seen by
many traders as close to Paris levels at about 205 euros to 206
euros, down 4-5 euros on late Friday business.

 * "The market is in an extreme state of uncertainty with
buyers and sellers far apart in price ideas following the recent
price swings," one German trader said. "There is also a lack of
sellers in the market."

 * German animal feed barley prices remained unusually high
and were again above bread wheat prices at around 210-215 euros
on Monday.

 * German barley prices had surged on Friday on hopes the
country will secure more overseas sales following Russia's grain
export ban. [ID:nLDE6750ZH]

 * Prompt feed wheat in leading grain port Tarragona quoted
at 205 euros a tonne &lt;GRA/ES&gt;, unchanged from Friday. Traders
could not confirm if any physical wheat had changed hands at
this price.

 * Farm union Asaja advised its members to be "cautious"
after recent rally and did not foresee a significant correction
soon.

 * "This rebound which cereal producers so needed (we must
recall that market prices have practically collapsed since 2008)
has come about due to circumstantial factors and interventions
by players from outside the sector," an Asaja statement said.
