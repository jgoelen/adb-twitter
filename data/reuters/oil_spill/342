 * FTSE 100 bounces 0.5 pct higher

 * Banks, insurers gain; RBS up after results * Oils, miners lifted by firmer commod prices * U.S. non-farm payrolls awaited 
 By Jon Hopkins LONDON, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Britain's leading shares pushed
higher in early trade on Friday, recovering following modest
declines in the previous three sessions, with banks rallying
after results from RBS (RBS.L), and commodity issues higher. But volumes were thin and some underlying caution remained
as investors awaited the key U.S. monthly jobs report. At 0804 GMT, the FTSE 100 .FTSE index was up 23.95 points,
or 0.5 percent at 5,389.73, having closed down 20.38 points, or
0.4 percent on Thursday. "We're anticipating another morning of tight trading, as we
saw yesterday afternoon, ahead of today's non-farm payrolls data
... but macro auguries do not bode well for the unemployment
situation," said Chris Purdey, financial trader at Spreadex. July's U.S. non-farm pay-rolls, due at 1230 GMT, are
forecast to have fallen by 65,000, after a 125,000 decrease in
June, with the unemployment rate seen at 9.6 percent, up from
9.5 percent in June. Royal Bank of Scotland led the banks higher on Friday, up
2.4 percent after lower impairment losses helped its second
quarter operating profit rise from the first quarter, and it
said it expected good medium-term prospects for its business. RBS which is 83 percent state-owned, posted an operating
profit of 869 million pounds ($1.38 billion) for the quarter
ending June 30, compared to its first quarter operating profit
of 713 million pounds. [ID:nLDE6741UI] But peer Barclays (BARC.L), which saw its first-half earning
disappoint on Thursday, missed out on the sector rally, shedding
1.5 percent, as UBS cut its rating to "neutral" from "buy". Among other financials, Old Mutual (OML.L) was the top FTSE
100 riser, up 3.3 percent after the Anglo-South African firm
reported a better than expected 43 percent jump in half-year
profit, helped by cost cuts. The group also said it had sold its U.S. life unit for $350
million to hedge fund Harbinger Capital. [ID: nLDE67506N] Insurers were bolstered by other recent well-received
results in the sector, with RSA Insurance (RSA.L) standing out,
up 2.3 percent as Jefferies raised its rating to "buy" from
"hold" following results on Thursday. Integrated oils were the top blue chip sector performers, as
the crude price CLc1 rose 0.5 percent, with BG Group (BG.L),
Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), and BP (BP.L) up 0.5 to 2.1 percent. BP finished pumping cement into its ruptured oil well in the
Gulf of Mexico on Thursday to seal off the source of the world's
worst offshore spill, paving the way to permanently plugging the
blow-out later this month. [ID:nLDE6740LH] Miners also added their strength to the index as copper
prices CMCU3 held steady and gold XAU= moved higher, with
Fresnillo (FRES.L) standing out, up 2.1 percent. The miners also got a boost as Exane BNP Paribas upped its
stance on the European sector to "outperform" from
"underperform" and raised individual ratings on Rio Tinto
(RIO.L), Xstrata (XTA.L) and Kazakhmys (KAZ.L). 
 LONMIN LOSES But Lonmin (LMI) missed out on the sector gains, topping the
FTSE 100 fallers list with a 4.7 percent drop after it said the
South African government had ordered it to stop selling nickel,
copper and other offshoots of its platinum production due to a
dispute over the prospecting rights. [ID:nLDE6741YQ]  Among other blue chip fallers, satellites operator Inmarsat
(ISA.L) shed 1.1 percent after second-quarter results which
Credit Suisse said were broadly in-line, although core revenues
were marginally weak. Inmarsat also confirmed a $1.2 billion order for a new fleet
of satellites. [ID:nLDE675056] And household products firm Unilever (ULVR.L) shed 1.3
percent as both UBS and ING downgraded their ratings for the
firm following disappointing second-quarter numbers on Thursday. Ahead of the key U.S. data on Friday, investors also awaited
UK July producer prices data and June industrial production
figures, both due at 0830 GMT.
