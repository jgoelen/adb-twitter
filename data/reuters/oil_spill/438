 * Dudley to meet Russia's top oil official, state oil CEO * Dudley's first trip to Russia since leaving in 2008 * May talk asset sales with Russian buyers  By Katya Golubkova MOSCOW, Aug 4 (Reuters) - BP's (BP.L) (BP.N) new Chief Executive Bob Dudley will meet Russia's top oil official to discuss projects and possibly asset sales on Wednesday, in the CEO's first visit since he fled the country in 2008. Russia is a key part of BP's global operation, providing the company with a quarter of its reserves before the U.S. oil spill, so it is vital for Dudley to establish a good working relationship with the world's largest oil exporting nation. Asset sales to pay for the damage from the Gulf of Mexico catastrophe, the world's largest accidental marine oil spill, may be on the agenda as Dudley, accompanied by outgoing BP CEO Tony Hayward, meet powerful Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin. BP, which took a $32.2 billion charge related to the spill in its results last week, has said it will sell $25 billion to $30 billion of assets to pay for the disaster. &quot;What we can be sure of is that Russia has a specific agenda, i.e. a wish list, and will take full advantage of BP's weakened state to press that,&quot; Chris Weafer, chief strategist at Russian brokerage Uralsib, said in an e-mailed note. Sechin, who is close to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, will meet Dudley and Hayward later on Wednesday to discuss joint projects, Sechin's spokesman said. As BP proceeds with a &quot;static kill&quot; operation to pump mud into its blown-out Gulf of Mexico well, the two sides will meet at the offices of Russia's largest oil producer, Rosneft (ROSN.MM), three industry sources said. [ID:nLDE6730OG] [ID:nN03166061] Dudley would also likely meet Rosneft CEO Sergei Bogdanchikov, and possibly Russia's number two producer LUKOIL, they said. Dudley and Hayward will travel independently of TNK-BP (TNBPI.RTS), the 50-50 joint venture which Dudley ran until he was forced out in 2008 amid a fierce dispute with the quartet of Russia-connected billionaires who co-owned the firm.  The oligarchs accused BP of running TNK-BP as if it were a subsidiary and oil executives say the Russians used their official connections to launch a campaign of attacks against the company by labour and migration agencies and security services to pressure BP into ceding operational control. After Dudley fled, initially to an undisclosed location in Europe, a truce was reached and BP eventually agreed to management changes which gave the oligarchs greater influence in the company and reduced the number of expatriates employed. Hayward, who established what both sides say was a good working relationship with Sechin, will take a non-executive director's seat at TNK-BP, which is Russia's number three oil producer. On Tuesday, Russian Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko rejected speculation that BP may be forced to sell its Russian assets -- which also include a 1.2 percent stake in Rosneft itself -- to fund losses from the spill. &quot;Looking at BP's share of production and reserves in Russia, the case can ... be made that it is a Russian operation,&quot; Uralsib's Weafer wrote. &quot;If BP is going to be squeezed more and more in the U.S., as recent reports suggest, then its Russian assets will become an even more important part of its future.&quot; Earlier this week a Rosneft official denied newspaper reports the Russian producer was in talks with BP on a buyout of its stake in a German refinery, Gelsenkirchen, a joint venture with Venezuela's PDVSA, and a network of German petrol stations. [ID:nLDE66S1A7] [ID:nN03208090] The sides must also decide the fate of the giant undeveloped Siberian Kovykta gas deposit which was slated for sale to Gazprom (GAZP.MM) [GAZPI.UL] in a deal that was never finalised. &quot;On the other hand, Russia needs to attract more investment into some areas of its energy sector and wants to promote its national energy companies on a global scale,&quot; Weafer added. &quot;If negotiations proceed well then both sides can gain considerably from recent events.&quot;  (Additional reporting by Jessica Bachman, Vladimir Soldatkin, Michael Stott and Melissa Akin; Writing by Melissa Akin; Editing by Sharon Lindores)
