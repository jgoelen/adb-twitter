 LONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Britain's top share index is seen
down 2 to 4 points at open on Wednesday after weakness in the
previous session, as measures by the U.S. Federal Reserve to
bolster its economy failed to provide much reassurance.

 The FTSE 100 .FTSE fell 34.11 points or 0.6 percent to
close at 5,376.41 on Tuesday, retreating from a high since May
13 set on Monday.

 The Fed's Open Market Committee said in a post-meeting
statement that it would begin funnelling proceeds from maturing
mortgage bonds into longer-term government debt to keep
borrowing costs low. For details, see [ID:nN09275781] 

 But U.S. stocks fell on the day suggesting investors did not
think the actions would swiftly resolve the weak employment
market or boost demand significantly.

 Stocks in Asia also dropped with Japan's Nikkei average
.N225 falling over 2.5 percent hurt by the yen's strength
against the dollar, which hovered within sight of a 15-year low
versus the Japanese currency JPY= after the Fed's move.

 British consumer morale fell to its lowest since May 2009
last month as households took a bleaker view of the outlook
following June's austere budget, building society Nationwide

 Investors will closely watch the Bank of England's latest
quarterly inflation report which is likely to suggest more
subdued growth over the next two years than in the May report,
due to the massive spending cuts announced by the new coalition
government in its June budget.

 The inflation forecasts, however, could be significantly
higher to take account of a rise in value added tax from 2011
and a recent surge in wheat prices.

 Ahead of that, employment data at 0830 GMT will be in focus.
The claimant count is forecast to fall 16,500 for July while the
ILO unemployment rate is forecast to remain stable at 7.8
percent.

 Barclays (BARC.L), BT Group (BT.L), Rio Tinto (RIO.L)  RSA
Insurance (RSA.L) Schroders (SDR.L) and Standard Chartered
(STAN.L) and Unilever (ULVR.L) are all going ex-dividend,
knocking a total of 6.10 points off the index.
