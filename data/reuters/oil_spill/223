HOUSTON (Reuters) - BP Plc on Tuesday suspended work on a relief well aiming to bore into its blown-out Gulf of Mexico oil well because of bad weather, a spokesman said.

Spokesman Max McGahan said BP stopped drilling because the National Hurricane Center said the system had a 60 percent chance of becoming a tropical depression in the next two days as it moves toward the Louisiana coast."We remain on location, but we've suspended drilling," McGahan said.The hurricane center had given the system in the southeastern Gulf a 50-50 chance of developing. Computer models forecast it will move northwest, crossing the spill site before making landfall in southeast Louisiana.The relief well is less than 100 feet from intercepting BP's Macondo well near its bottom about 13,000 feet (2.4 miles) beneath the seabed, BP said.A plug has been placed in the relief well to keep it stable during the interruption, BP said.Last week BP filled the well with drilling mud and then cement from the top, and the relief well's intercept at the bottom is intended to make sure the leak is permanently plugged.
