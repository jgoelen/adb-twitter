BOSTON (Reuters) - The Gulf of Mexico oil spill has spurred a race within the scientific community to develop faster ways of identifying U.S. seafood tainted by petroleum.

Nearly a quarter of Gulf waters (58,000 square miles/150,000 square km) remain closed to commercial fishing, more than 100 days after the BP oil spill started gushing in late April.Now the speed and accuracy of testing of samples for contamination has become more important to fishing-related industries devastated by the environmental catastrophe.The U.S. Gulf Coast is a rich breeding ground for fish, crabs, oysters and shrimp, and accounts for about 20 percent of the nation's total commercial seafood production.In 2008, commercial fishermen in the Gulf of Mexico harvested more than 1 billion pounds (454 million kg) of fish and shellfish, according to government statistics.With fisherman desperate to get back to work, testing for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the toxic chemical compound found in oil, can take five days. That has created concerns a backlog of samples will delay reopening of Gulf waters.However, a number of companies and academic researchers have developed new -- but often more expensive -- tests that take as little as just a few hours to conduct."We are trying to come up with confirmatory methods that are faster," said Jim Bradford, executive director at AOAC International, an independent analytical standards organization.The group's methods of scientific analysis are recognized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which safeguards the nation's food supply.AOAC is currently sifting through 20 different methods that test for seafood contamination, and after putting the five most promising candidates through more rigorous tests will recommend a new official method of testing to the U.S. government.A decision could come within 90 days, Bradford said.CRUNCH TIMEAOAC has not issued a list of the contenders, but one firm in the hunt is Thermo Fisher Scientific, based in Waltham, Massachusetts.The scientific instrument maker said its method could reduce testing time to just three hours."We designed this method not only to detect PAHs, but to determine the hydrocarbon profile to match that oil rig," said Vincent Paez, Thermo Fisher's director of food safety business development, who went to the Gulf to obtain an oil sample used in creating the Thermo Fisher model.Until the AOAC completes its review, Thermo Fisher is marketing its method as a screening tool for labs.While the current NOAA method is easily replicated in laboratories, some of the potential alternative methods under consideration could mean big bills for some labs.The Thermo Fisher method requires an equipment investment of about $225,000, but ultimately could save on solvent and lab tool costs, as well as employee time, Paez said. "The payback period for our method is about six to seven months," he said.(Reporting by Lauren Keiper; Editing by Ros Krasny and Mark Egan)
