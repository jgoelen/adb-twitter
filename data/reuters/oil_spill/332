 * U.S. stock index futures pointed to a slightly higher open
on Wall Street on Friday ahead of U.S. monthly jobs data.

 * At 0757 GMT, futures for the S&amp;P 500 SPc1 were up 0.11
percent, Dow Jones DJc1 futures up 0.17 percent and Nasdaq 100
NDc1 futures up 0.32 percent. * The U.S. Labor Department's employment report is expected
at 1230 GMT. A survey of 75 economists forecast nonfarm payrolls
dropped 65,000 after declining 125,000 in June. Private-sector
hiring, considered a better gauge of health in the jobs market,
is seen rising 90,000 after increasing 83,000 in June.
[ID:nN05598486] * Crude oil prices were steady on Friday above $82, while
the dollar was on the defensive near a 3-1/2 month low against a
basket of currencies ahead of the payroll data. * European stocks were up 0.6 percent, just shy of a 3-month
high hit in the previous session, as investors hoped for a
strong jobs figure from the private sector that could continue
to fuel the stock rally. * Kraft Foods Inc (KFT.N) will be in the spotlight after it
reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its
target for cost savings from the acquisition of Cadbury, sending
its shares up 2.9 percent in extended trading. [ID:nN05176007]
Shares of Kraft traded in Frankfurt (KFT.F) were up 2.2 percent. * Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) will also be in focus
after it set a forecast for the current quarter that was below
Wall Street's targets, raising fears about its just-released
"StarCraft II" title and sending its shares down 6 percent in
after-hours trading. [ID:nN04105733] * Saudi Arabia and BlackBerry maker Research In Motion
(RIM.TO) (RIMM.O) are making progress in talks over access to
the device's encrypted network, a source close to the
negotiations said, and the kingdom had yet to carry out threats
to cut its Messenger service early Friday morning.
[ID:nN05199262] * BP (BP.L) (BP.N) finished pumping cement into its ruptured
oil well in the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday to seal off the
source of the world's worst offshore spill, paving the way to
permanently plug the blow-out later this month. * Shoe company Crocs Inc (CROX.O) posted a second-quarter
profit that beat Wall Street on lower costs and strong sales,
especially in the Americas region, and forecast a strong third
quarter, boosting shares 9 percent after market. [ID:nSGE6740M1] * On the earnings front, investors awaited results from AIG
(AIG.N), Pepco (POM.N), Progress Energy (PGN.N), and The
Washington Post (WPO.N). * U.S. stocks edged lower on Thursday as an unexpected rise
in initial jobless claims and unimpressive July retail sales
dimmed optimism ahead of the monthly payrolls report. * The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI slipped 5.45
points, or 0.05 percent, to 10,674.98. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
Index .SPX dropped 1.43 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,125.81.
The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC lost 10.51 points, or 0.46
percent, to 2,293.06.
