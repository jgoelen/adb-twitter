 (Adds conference call details, updates shares) BANGALORE, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Clean Harbors Inc's (CLH.N)
quarterly results zoomed past estimates, boosted by its
involvement in clean-up operations related to the Gulf of
Mexico oil spill, prompting the waste-management company to
raise its full-year revenue view. The oil-spill response, which had driven shares of
companies like Clean Harbors and Nalco Holding (NLC.N) in
recent months, contributed $109 million, or 23 percent, to
Clean Harbors' second-quarter revenue. Click for related stories - [ID:nSGE6440JP] [ID:nSGE6420IN] Clean Harbors also raised its 2010 capital expenditure view
to about $80 million, from its earlier range of $65 million to
$70 million, citing its role in the spill clean-up. "We certainly are getting new assignments as oil is found
in differeNt areas and as (customers) reduce the size of the
response groups down there," a company executive said on a
conference call. The company, however, sees oil spill response-related
activities -- which mainly came through seven customers -- to
reduce in the third quarter and wind down to significantly
lower levels in the fourth quarter. On Wednesday, oil company BP (BP.L) (BP.N) claimed "a
significant milestone" in efforts to plug its leaking well for
good, ahead of a U.S. government report that will show most of
the spilt crude is already gone. [ID:nLDE67310T] Clean Harbors said it was conservative in its outlook given
the ever-changing nature of the oil spill, and forecast 2010
revenue of $1.60 billion to $1.65 billion, including revenue
through the third quarter from the spill. It had earlier forecast $1.40 billion to $1.45 billion. Analysts on an average were expecting full-year revenue of
$1.62 billion. Second-quarter net income rose to $57.9 million, or $2.19 a
share, from $8.6 million, or 36 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding items, the company earned $1.48 a share, compared
with estimates of 87 cents a share, according to Thomson
Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue more than doubled to $471.6 million, beating
analysts' estimate of $422.3 million. In May, Clean Harbors had said second-quarter revenue was
expected to better market estimates by 15 percent to 20 percent
on the back of higher sales related to the oil spill.

2 percent at $64.42 Wednesday morning on the New York Stock
Exchange.
