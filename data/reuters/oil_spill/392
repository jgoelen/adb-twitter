 * Caution prevails ahead of monthly jobs report Friday * Initial claims due at 8:30 am ET * Futures up: S&amp;P 1.2 pts, Dow 15 pts, Nasdaq 4.75 pts * For up-to-the-minute market news see [STXNEWS/US] NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures edged
higher on Thursday as investors took a cautious track ahead of
the morning's labor data, a precursor to Friday's monthly jobs
report. * Initial jobless claims, due at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT),
are expected to show first-time jobless benefits dipped to
455,000 last week from 457,000 the week before. [ECI/US] * The report comes ahead of Friday's closely watched
monthly nonfarm payrolls report, with economists forecasting a
drop of 65,000 in July as U.S. Census Bureau jobs dried up,
while private employers are expected to add 90,000 jobs.
Better-than-expected data out of the private sector on
Wednesday helped temper some jitters. * Investors have been anxious to see improvement in the
jobs market with high unemployment remaining a major roadblock
to a sustainable recovery. Worries that the pace of the
recovery is slowing have also plagued investors of late. * The S&amp;P 500 held above its 200-day moving average for a
third day in a row on Wednesday, indicating positive underlying
strength. * S&amp;P 500 futures SPc1 rose 1.2 points and were above
fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into
account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 gained 15
points, and Nasdaq 100 futures NDc1 added 4.75 points. * Monthly chain store sales for July are also on tap on
Thursday. Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) reported a 6 percent
rise in July sales, marginally beating estimates. For stories,
see [ID:nN02273562] and [ID:nSGE6740C7] * BP Plc's (BP.L)(BP.N) U.S.-listed shares rose 3.3 percent
to $40.67 in premarket trade on hopes its oil well in the Gulf
of Mexico will soon be permanently sealed and after U.S.
President Barack Obama said the battle to contain the massive
oil spill was nearly over. [ID:nLDE6740LH] * Earlier Thursday, insurer Cigna Corp (CI.N) reported a
far higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its
full-year forecast. [ID:nN05203383] * Stocks rose in thin trade on Wednesday, lifted by
retailers' earnings and better-than-expected economic data.
