NEW YORK (Reuters) - Implied volatility of an option contract is often used as a tool to predict post-earnings stock movements. But this earnings season, unusual intraday swings on the implied move may be giving out mixed messages.

The lack of liquidity in the options market and uncertain macro-economic conditions are to blame for the swings, options investors said, making it difficult to set their positions ahead of earnings.The general pattern is for implied volatility, an estimate of stock movement, to build up and reach its peak just before a big events like earnings or options expiration.But since mid-July when earnings kicked off, some of the big-named stocks like Apple (AAPL.O), Google (GOOG.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) have shown high implied volatility in the morning session, and then a sudden plunge in the afternoon, closing at its lowest or highest level just ahead of results."There is probably a bit more 'volatility of volatility' on an intraday basis this season," said Perry Piazza, director of investment strategy at Contango Capital Advisors in San Francisco."It hasn't been a good market for hedge funds with the S&amp;P 500 .SPX crossing the 1,100 level five or six times since late April. Their returns are flat on year and they are chopping a bit of their options positions," causing liquidity to dry up, he said.As of late July, an average daily volume of options was at 13.8 million, compared to 16.6 million in mid-June, according to Steve Claussen, chief investment strategist at online brokerage OptionHouse.com in Chicago.Also, options investors who bought July and August contracts with hefty premiums in June are in a hurry to book profits, causing more intraday swings than expected."Everyone knew earnings were coming up in July and August, so they prepared for that by buying July and August options. But because the market had such a violent snap back, they have given back a lot of the premiums that they paid and are basically sitting on these hedges that are melting away," said Justin Golden, strategist at Macro Risk Advisors in New York.In the last week of June, the S&amp;P 500 index gave up about 8.5 percent. The index fell to 1,022 on July 2, the lowest of the year."So what you do is hedge or take profit on the short-term option positions by buying or selling a stock sooner than you may normally do during earnings period." he said.EXTERNAL FACTORSIn July, the markets endured malaise with poor economic data and downbeat testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, which often overshadowed strong corporate earnings."Right now, macro conditions are really driving up stocks, more so than anything related to earnings. Depending on the 'external news' of the day, like data, financial regulation, or the BP oil spill, the implied volatility moves regardless of forecast or prediction," said Ralph Fogel, investment strategist at Fogel Neale Partners in New York."There's been a number of occasions when a stock had really good earnings, but then throughout the day, it would give the gains back."As of July 30, 75 percent of the 336 companies in the S&amp;P 500 Index that have reported earnings beat analyst expectations, compared to an average of 62 percent for a typical quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/.Implied volatility, a key component of options prices, measures the expected movement in stocks calculated by options prices. It is also seen as a barometer of anxiety.(Reporting by Angela Moon, Editing by Andrew Hay)
