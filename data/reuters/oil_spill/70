Economists, Industry Leaders and Policy Experts to Meet for Semi-Annual Economy
Summit
LEXINGTON, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
The world economy is recovering, though at different speeds around the globe,
yet growth is losing momentum in the face of storm clouds on the horizon. IHS
Global Insight's Fall World Economic Outlook Conference, October 19-21 in
Washington, D.C., will explore the aftershocks of The Great Recession and the
looming opportunities and risks for global business and policy decisions. 

Economists, experts and government and industry leaders will discuss how to
maneuver in a multi-speed economy with Asia in the fast lane, Europe in the slow
lane and North America in the middle. Speakers and panels will consider the
global push for financial regulations, Europe's sovereign debt challenges, the
shifting geopolitical balance in Asia, economic uncertainties in emerging
markets and the mid-term elections in the United States and options for fiscal
policy. 

For more than 20 years, the World Economic Outlook Conference has been widely
considered the leading forum on the direction of the global economy. This year's
conference will offer critical assessments and analyses by experts from IHS
Global Insight, IHS CERA, IHS Jane's, as well as from outside experts, top
academics and industry leaders. Issues to be examined include:

* The strength and sustainability of the global economic recovery. 
* Will financial regulation reform reduce systemic risk or stifle innovation? 
* What are the economic and policy impacts of the oil spill in the Gulf of
Mexico? 
* Is debt restructuring avoidable in Europe and what does it mean for regional
growth? 
* Is a double dip recession in the cards for the U.S. and what are the options
for U.S. fiscal policy? 
* What do the U.S. mid-term elections foreshadow and will the President and the
new Congress be able to work together on the next big challenges?

"The global economic recovery is losing steam and the future is filled with
uncertainty," said conference chair IHS Chief Economist Nariman Behravesh. "Asia
is recovering more strongly and more quickly than the rest of the globe; Europe
is barely treading water and the U.S. just seems to be muddling along, despite
the near death and miraculous recovery of the nation's iconic automotive
industry." 

"This fall's World Economic Outlook Conference has assembled an impressive list
of experts to make sense of it all with insights and perspectives aimed at
helping leaders grapple with these challenges and build more effective business
strategies," Behravesh added. 

Speakers and Panel Discussion Participants:

* Alan Blinder, professor of economics, Princeton University, and former vice
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. 
* Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute 
* George Buckley, chairman, president and chief executive officer, 3M 
* David Leonhardt, economics writer, The New York Times
* David Wessel, economics editor, the Wall Street Journal
* William Gale, Arjay and Frances Miller chair in Federal Economic Policy, the
Brookings Institution 
* Valerie Plagnol, chief strategist, CM-CIC Securities 
* Karen Shaw Petrou, co-founder and managing partner of Federal Financial
Analytics, Inc. 
* Peter Wallison, Arthur F. Burns Fellow, Financial Policy Studies, American
Enterprise Institute 
* Philip Suttle, Institute of International Finance

Focus Discussions:

* Healthcare - Outlook for the healthcare and pharma markets and implications
for the industry. 
* Pricing and Purchasing - Outlook for aerospace and defense materials and
labor; factors driving manufacturers and suppliers costs.
