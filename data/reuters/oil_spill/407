DALLAS Aug 4 (Reuters) - BP Plc (BP.L) (BP.N) can pump
cement into its blown-out Gulf of Mexico oil well to begin
sealing the leak for good, the U.S. official in charge of the
spill said on Wednesday.

 "Based on the successful completion of the static kill
procedure and a positive evaluation of the test results, I have
authorized BP to cement its damaged well," retired Coast Guard
Admiral Thad Allen said in a brief statement.
