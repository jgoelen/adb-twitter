 LONDON, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE index is seen opening
up 48 to 53 points, or 1.0 percent higher on Monday, according to financial
bookmakers, recovering all of Friday's falls in tandem with overnight gains in
most of Asia after Wall Street pared back sharp falls late on Friday.

 Commodity issues are likely to lead the bounce back in London as the price
of metals and crude oil CLc1 rose in Asian trade, boosted by a slide in the
U.S. dollar on expectations of further Federal Reserve action after Friday's
weak U.S. jobs report.

 The UK blue chip index closed down 33.39 points, or 0.6 percent on Friday at
5,332.39 after the weak U.S. jobs data cast doubt over the sustainability of the
global economic recovery.

 Wall Street fell on Friday after the larger-than-expected drop in July
payrolls but, in late afternoon trade, U.S. stocks pared back earlier sharp
losses that had driven the major indexes down 1 percent or more.

 And the MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan index .MIAPJ0000PUS rose to a fresh
three-month high on Monday as the U.S. dollar fell against emerging Asian
currencies on Monday on growing expectations the Federal Reserve will have to
buy more bonds to support the flagging economy.

 But in Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index .N225 missed out as exporters suffered
with the yen hovering within striking distance of a 15-year high against the
struggling dollar, and with dealers alert for possible government intervention
to weaken the currency.

 No important domestic economic data will be released on Monday, with little
due all week, although June unemployment numbers and the August Bank of England
inflation report will be a big draw on Wednesday.
Across the Atlantic, after Friday's U.S. July jobs report, investors will
only have the July employment index data to digest on Monday, so all eyes will
be on the latest Federal Reserve rate decision, due after the London market
close on Tuesday, although no change is expected to U.S. monetary policy yet.
