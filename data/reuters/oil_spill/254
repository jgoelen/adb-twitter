HOUSTON Aug 9 (Reuters) - Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N),
part owner of the well involved in the Gulf of Mexico oil
spill, said on Monday it priced a $2 billion debt offering and
will now not need a $1.5 billion loan it previously lined up.

 On Aug. 3, Anadarko said it raised $6.5 billion in
financing commitments, in part to pay for potential liability
from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The $1.5 billion senior
secured six-year term loan was part of that package. Anadarko, based in Houston, priced its registered public
offering of $2 billion, 6.375 percent senior notes due 2017 and
expects to close the offering on Aug. 12, the company said. The U.S. oil and gas company said it will use the net
proceeds from the offering to repay about $1.3 billion in debt
due December 2012. Anadarko owns 25 percent of BP Plc's(BP.L) (BP.N) blown out
Macondo well.
