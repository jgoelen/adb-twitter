 LONDON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE index is seen opening
up 17-20 points, or 0.4 percent, on Friday, according to financial bookmakers,
extending Thursday's rally in tandem with overnight gains by Asian equities.
Commodity shares are likely to be supported by steadier metal and oil prices.

 The UK blue-chip index closed 20.85 points, or 0.4 percent, higher on
Thursday at 5,266.06, as defensively-perceived stocks gained, after hitting its
lowest close in three weeks on Wednesday when it dropped 2.4 percent.

 Asian stocks edged higher on Friday, clawing back some of the week's heavy
losses made on global growth fears, with some analysts citing a normal snap back
from over-sold or over-bought regions.

 U.S. stocks ended down for a third straight day on Thursday as an unexpected
rise in jobless claims and a sobering revenue outlook from Cisco (CSCO.O)
underscored the hurdles to economic recovery in the aftermath of a gloomier
outlook from the U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday.

 In the absence of any domestic data, the main macro focus on Friday will be
on euro zone second quarter GDP numbers and a big batch of  U.S. economic
pointers.

 Growth in the euro zone is likely to have picked up in the second quarter
after modest expansion in the first three months of 2010 helped by a recovery in
construction output. A Reuters poll of 33 economists gave a consensus forecast
of up 0.7 percent for the Q2 flash estimate. [ID:nLDE6750TQ]

 U.S. inflation numbers will be the main focus in the afternoon, with a 0.3
percent monthly increase forecast for July CPI, after a 0.1 percent fall in
June, giving an annual rise of 1.2 percent, up from 1.1 percent.

 July U.S. retail sales numbers will also be released at 1230 GMT, while the
first reading of the Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for
August will be released at 1355 GMT.

 Technical indicators for the FTSE 100 index remain bearsish, according to
Raghee Horner, chief market analyst at Autochartist.

 "The intraday trends across the 30 and 60-minute charts are still down and
this has to be of concern to buyers who must now wait for the FTSE to rally
through the 5281 to 5320 area of resistance before shifting the intraday trend
back up."
