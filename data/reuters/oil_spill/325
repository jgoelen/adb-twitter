WASHINGTON Aug 6 (Reuters) - Four U.S. senators have
written to Britain's Foreign Secretary curtly demanding more
information to help clear up the "public pall" over the release
of the Lockerbie bomber to Libya. In an accusing tone rarely used with the United States'
closest ally, the senators said it appeared British trade
interests with Libya had "won out over justice" in last year's
release of the man convicted of the 1988 bombing of an airliner
over Lockerbie, Scotland. "It would behoove all of us if you can bring greater
transparency to these matters," the four senators told British
Foreign Secretary William Hague. They asked whether Britain's previous Labor government
could have prevented Abdel Basset al-Megrahi from being
returned to Libya after he was released by Scottish authorities
on compassionate grounds because of ill health. Hague belongs to British Prime Minister David Cameron's
Tory party. Megrahi was freed while Hague and Cameron were in
opposition, and they have both said the release was wrong. The letter was signed by the two U.S. senators from New
Jersey, Robert Menendez and Frank Lautenberg, as well as the
two senators from New York, Charles Schumer and Kirsten
Gillebrand. All four are Democrats. Most of the 270 people killed in the 1988 bombing were
Americans. Megrahi's release last year to a triumphant
homecoming in Libya provoked an outcry in the United States. U.S. anger over the BP (BP.L) oil spill in the Gulf of
Mexico renewed interest in whether BP pushed for the bomber's
release as it sought business with Libya. BP denies this. MILIBAND'S REMARKS QUESTIONED Hague wrote a seven-page letter to the Senate last month
saying there was no evidence BP was connected to the release. But the senators said comments by former Foreign Secretary
David Miliband -- quoted in Hague's letter -- as well as a
letter to Scottish authorities from the Libyan British Business
Council urging Megrahi's release, showed trade considerations
and British government attitudes may have been influential. Miliband, who worked for the previous Labor government, was
quoted as saying that "British interests, including those of UK
nationals, British businesses and possibly security
cooperation, would be damaged -- perhaps badly -- if Megrahi
were to die in a Scottish prison." The senators wanted to have a hearing last month on
Lockerbie, but postponed after witnesses from Britain refused
to appear. BP's former CEO Tony Hayward, former British Justice
Minister Jack Straw, and Scottish officials all declined. A British diplomat said the letter would be given the same
consideration as earlier correspondence from the senators, but
"we've already released quite a lot of information."
