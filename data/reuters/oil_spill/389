WASHINGTON Aug 5 (Reuters) - Mexico's state oil company Pemex will
delay the start of its Maximino exploration oil well until next year due to
concerns about deepwater drilling in the wake of the BP Plc (BP.L) oil
spill disaster, a top regulator said Thursday.

 "We are more concerned about best practices in deepwater," Juan Carlos
Zepeda, the head of Mexico's recently formed National Hydrocarbons
Commission (CNH), told reporters at an energy conference. He said it would start up sometime next year, but would not estimate
when. It had been expected to start during the fourth quarter of this
year. Mexico believes billions of barrels of oil lie in the deep waters of
the Gulf, but exploration efforts are only beginning. There are concerns
about drilling safely and Pemex [PEMX.UL] has drilled less than 20
deepwater wells. In the United States, the April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon
oil rig killed 11 workers and hurt the billion dollar fishing and tourism
industries across five states along the Gulf of Mexico. The 9,600 foot (2900 meter) Maximino well lies about 18.5 miles (30k)
from the U.S. border at sea. Zepeda said the delay would "give us the correct timing for finishing
working with Pemex on their review of internal regulation and, in case it's
necessary on top of that, specific regulation for exploration and
production."
