BOSTON Aug 9 (Reuters) - Matthew Simmons, who argued the
world was rapidly approaching peak oil production capacity and
predicted that BP Plc (BP.L)'s would be driven bankrupt, died
at his home in North Haven, Maine, the energy research group he
founded said on Monday.

 He died suddenly on Sunday, his Ocean Energy Institute said
in a statement. Simmons, 67, a former adviser to U.S. President George W.
Bush, had a heart attack while in a hot tub, local media
reported, citing the Knox County Sheriff's Office. In his 2005 book "Twilight in the Desert," Simmons argued
that Saudi Arabia's oil reserves were nearing the highest
levels of production they were capable of achieving, after
which point the world's yearly oil supply would begin to
decline. While Simmons's views on peak oil were regarded as somewhat
controversial, he drew even more attention for a June 9
interview with Fortune magazine, in which he predicted BP had
"about a month before they declare Chapter 11" as the cleanup
costs for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill mounted. A week later, Simmons &amp; Co International, the investment
bank that Simmons founded in 1974, said it was cutting ties
with its founder who until that point had served as chairman
emeritus. Simmons in 2007 founded the Ocean Energy Institute, a
self-described think tank and venture capital fund focused on
offshore renewable energy technology.(Reporting by Scott Malone and Edward McAllister; Editing by
