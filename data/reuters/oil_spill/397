 LONDON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE index is seen opening
up 7-8 points, or 0.2 percent on Thursday according to financial bookmakers, in
tandem with overnight gains on Wall Street and in Asia, recouping similar-sized
falls in the previous session.

 Investor attention in London is likely to be on another swathe of corporate
results, including earnings from blue chips Barclays (BARC.L), Rio Tinto (RIO.L)
and Unilever (ULVR.L), as well as the monthly interest rate announcement from
the Bank of England.

 The UK blue chip index closed down 10.32 points, or 0.2 percent on Wednesday
at 5,386.16, having bounced back from a mid-session low of 5,318.7 in the
afternoon as Wall Street posted modest gains after some reassuring U.S. data.

 U.S. stocks closed higher in thin trade on Wednesday as retailers' earnings
and a report showing a slight improvement in private employment boosted optimism
ahead of Friday's payrolls report.

 Asian stocks edged higher on Thursday also helped by some solid corporate
earnings, including from Toyota Motor and chipmaker UMC.

 No change in monetary policy is expected from the Bank of England when it
announces its interest rate decision at 1100 GMT. [nLDE67316S]

 Severe UK budget cuts and the possibility of slower growth ahead will force
the Bank of England to wait until the second quarter of 2011 to raise interest
rates, according to a Reuters poll of 61 economists. [ID:nLDE66R227]

 The European Central Bank will also make its latest interest rate
announcement at 1145 GMT on Thursday, with no change expected either.

 Ahead of those interest rate decisions, no important British economic data
will be released on Thursday, so investors' attention will be on the latest U.S.
weekly jobless claims, due at 1230 GMT, a key indicator ahead of Friday's
always-important U.S. monthly jobs report.
