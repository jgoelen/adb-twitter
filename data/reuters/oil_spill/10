 By Christopher Mangham and Alasdair Reilly LONDON, August 17 (Reuters) - BP's (BP.L) two secured loans
worth a total of $5 billion mark a change in the company's
strategy to raise funds in the wake of the oil spill in the Gulf
of Mexico, bankers close to the deal said on Tuesday. The new loans, announced on Monday, are non-recourse to BP
and are being borrowed without a guarantee from the parent by
its subsidiaries BP Angola and BP Caspian. In July, BP outlined $16 billion of borrowing facilities --
mainly bilateral loans -- that were full recourse to the
borrower to shore up its overall liquidity position following
the world's worst offshore oil spill. "BP's new pre-export loans are non-recourse as its previous
bilateral loans are full recourse. The company doesn't want to
affect its credit rating by taking more debt on to its balance
sheet," a senior banker close to the deal said. The new borrowing strategy also enables BP to tap new areas
of liquidity. "The new loans are a pure diversification of liquidity play
and take advantage of a very strong liquidity pool for
structured assets," a second senior banker close to the deal
said. &lt;--------------------------------------------------

 NEW LOANS The new fully underwritten, five-year, amortising term
loans, which will also help BP's overall liquidity position,
comprise a $2 billion deal backed by crude sales from BP's
interest in the Azeri-Chirag-Deepwater Gunashli field in
Azerbaijan, and a $3 billion loan for BP Angola which is backed
by BP Angola's crude oil sales. [ID:nLDE67F0U4] The loans pay margins of 250 bps over LIBOR for the first
two years, rising to 300 bps for year three, then 325 bps
thereafter, the bankers said."The margins reflect the deals are non-recourse to BP and are
priced for Azerbaijani and Angolan risk," a senior banker close
to the deal said. "There is no guarantee from BP and there is no
premium being paid for the BP name." Royal Bank of Scotland and Societe Generale are arranging
the $2 billion loan while BNP Paribas and Standard Chartered are
arranging the $3 billion loan which matures on June 30, 2015. Syndication of the loans was launched simultaneously on
Monday and commitments are due on Sept. 13, with signing of the
new commitments scheduled to take place before the end of
September. Banks are being encouraged to commit to both loans with
larger commitments for substantially enhanced fees, the bankers
said. BP has agreed to fund a $20 billion escrow account over the
next three and a half years to cover claims under the Oil
Pollution Act of 1990. While the escrow account is building, the
company has provided assurance by setting aside U.S. assets with
a value of $20 billion.
