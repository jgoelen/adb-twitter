NEW DELHI Aug 9 (Reuters) - Three crude tankers holding
about 1.5 million barrels of crude oil for Bharat Petroleum
Corp (BPCL.BO) are stranded at the Mumbai port, which has been
shut following an oil spill, a company spokesman said on
Monday.

 "Our three cargoes-- two cargoes of 80,000 tonnes each and
one of 40,000 tonnes- are waiting in outer anchorage for
berthing," said the BPCL spokesman.  Another official said a 30,000 tonne naphtha export cargo
was waiting to sail from the Mumbai port. "We have loaded the
cargo for Marubeni, but because of restrictions it cannot leave
the port," he said. A third company source said if operations at the Mumbai
port continued to be suspended for another 3-4 days, his firm
might divert the crude oil cargoes to its 150,000 barrels per
day (bpd) Kochi plant in southern India. BPCL also operates a 240,000 bpd refinery in Mumbai where
another state refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL.BO) owns a
110,000 bpd plant.(Reporting by Nidhi Verma; editing by Surojit Gupta)
