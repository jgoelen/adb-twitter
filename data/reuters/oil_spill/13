			WESTHOPE, N.D., Aug. 17 /PRNewswire/ -- "Its our ocean, its our industry, its our time to help," said Laurie Cunnington, President of Ward Williston Oil Company, when she announced today that her company raised over $60,000 at their "Golf For the Gulf" Charity Open to help oil workers and fishermen hardest hit by the oil spill in Louisiana."North Dakota has a thriving economy," said Cunnington.  "The unemployment rate is only 2.5% and the state has a surplus of money, all because of the oil industry.  When we saw the trouble our fellow oil workers were facing in the gulf we decided to do something about it.  North Dakota oil people stepped up to the challenge and because of their generosity, the event was completely sold out and we were able to raise a substantial amount of money."North Dakota is thriving because of the Bakken Formation, one of the largest oil finds in the United States with an estimated 4.3 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil. The Bakken Formation is partially located in the northwestern part of the state right where Ward Williston has their operations.   Because of this strategic placement, Ward Williston has emerged as a key player in the Bakken Oil Patch.  With an infrastructure already well in place, Ward Williston services over 1,000 wells in the state, providing a turn-key operation to many of the oil companies now moving into North Dakota. Ward Williston Oil Company has been in the business of oil since 1952 and has operations in Westhope, Stanley, Mohall and Lignite.  For a complete list of oil services call the oil service hotline at 1-800-737-9485 or go to www.wardwilliston.com.
