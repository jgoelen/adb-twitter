DUESSELDORF Germany (Reuters) - BP Plc does not plan to divest any of the businesses in its BP Europe SE division as part of plans to sell $30 billion in assets over the next 18 months to cover costs from the Gulf spill disaster.

BP Europe SE chief Uwe Franke told reporters on Wednesday evening that his region, which includes Germany, Poland, Netherlands, Belgium and Austria, would remain untouched."In this unit there are no disposals planned," he said, adding Switzerland and Luxembourg would not be affected either ahead of their integration with BP Europe SE.This would for instance include its downstream petrol tanking station chain Aral, which Germany business weekly WirtschaftsWoche recently reported BP would in fact sell."No one intends to sel Aral," Franke said.This would also likely include BP's massive oil refinery in Rotterdam, Nerefco.(Reporting by Tom Kaeckenhoff; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)
