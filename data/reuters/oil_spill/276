Half-Yearly Report

PERFORMANCE

The Japanese equity market experienced two distinctly different investment
phases during the review period. Improving economic and corporate fundamentals,
coupled with diminished concerns about equity financing and sovereign credit
risk, fuelled a share price rally towards mid-April. Meanwhile, robust US
economic data and monetary easing by the Bank of Japan contributed to a
weakening of the yen, which provided a tailwind for exporters. After peaking in
mid-April, however, global equity markets declined sharply, and Japanese stocks
also underwent a sharp correction, hitting fresh year to date lows. A string of
weaker than expected economic indicators in the US and policy tightening in
China gave rise to doubts about the sustainability of the global recovery. At
the same time, mounting concerns about sovereign credit risk in Europe and a
sharp drop in the euro precipitated a flight from risk among overseas
investors.

While the resignation of Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama and subsequent
appointment of Naoto Kan as his successor did little to stir the Japanese
equity market, reports of further capital raising in the banking sector renewed
concerns about equity supply and demand. Exporters, financials and
commodity-related stocks were notably weak against this backdrop. In contrast,
defensive sectors and beneficiaries of lower oil prices held up relatively
well, and domestic-oriented small caps were less affected than larger
companies.

Over the review period, your Company's net asset value increased by 4.37p per
share (7.9%) to 59.93p per share. The discount, although high, remained stable.
Gearing had a negative impact of 0.65p (calculated on a pre-exchange rate
basis) while a strengthening of the yen against sterling added 7.34p. Index
performance detracted from performance by 2.35p, but the portfolio manager's
stock selection contributed 0.31p. The Board is noticing the benefits of the
reduced interest costs of using Contacts For Difference for gearing purposes as
compared with traditional loans.

Performance for the six months to 30 June 2010

In sterling terms

Sources: Fidelity and Datastream

Although in the period the net gain from stock selection was modest, the focus
on fast growing internet-related businesses was beneficial. The leading
contributor was M3, which provides marketing support services based around its
internet communications tool linking doctors and pharmaceutical companies in
Japan and overseas. M3's quarterly sales growth has been stronger than expected
with a solid increase in its average annual revenue per user for the ten top
clients. Holdings in leading social networking service operators, including
Gree and DeNA, also performed strongly as the surging popularity of their
social games fuelled expectations that growth in user activity would boost
their earnings. In addition, strong quarterly earnings growth and an increase
in dividend boosted investors' confidence in Bit-Isle, which operates internet
data centres.

Elsewhere, a holding in Asahi Diamond Industrial aided performance. Its share
price rose on the expectation of the increased application of electroplated
diamond wire in solar cell and LED markets and this bodes well for the company.
A generic drug maker Sawai Pharmaceutical also ranked among the top performers
following the government directive to promote the use of generic drugs.

Conversely, Toyota Motor's product recall in the US weighed on investor
sentiment towards auto parts makers Toyota Boshoku and Takata. Adding to their
woes were renewed concerns about the outlook for the global recovery and the
negative impact of a stronger yen on earnings. We have retained these stocks
because we believe that the negative news flows have been reflected in the
share price. We maintain the overweight position in LEC, a producer of plastic
goods for the household products industry, despite recent share price weakness
as the company's fundamentals remain solid with healthy sales growth.
Meanwhile, the weak performance of Panasonic Electric Works reflected
disappointment over the company's conservative earnings guidance for fiscal
2010.

THE MARKET & OUTLOOK

In recent weeks, global markets have become increasingly volatile, as the
ramifications of the debt crisis in the Eurozone are felt right across the
world. However, it is not just the sovereign debt problems that have unsettled
markets. While the summer months typically usher in a period of reduced trading
volumes and constrained market movements, conditions are likely to remain
turbulent for the time being and we may see a further retreat from higher risk
assets. On the upside, better than expected corporate earnings could provide a
lift to market sentiment. In the wake of the financial crisis, Japanese
companies cut costs aggressively in order to protect their profit margins. This
pre-emptive action has left many companies operationally geared into improving
top-line growth and could produce a string of earnings upgrades for the quarter
ended 30 June 2010.

Over the coming months, the pace of the economic recovery is likely to
moderate, which is consistent with decelerating but positive trends in exports
and production. Although this signals a slowdown over the near term, recent
data is not indicative of a hard landing. Generally strong economic growth in
Asia, which accounts for around 55% of Japanese export trade, should continue
to support the export-led recovery.

While the sovereign debt crisis in Europe is a concern in terms of the impact
on global financial markets, the Eurozone itself accounts for only 11% of
Japanese exports.

Of greater concern is the effect of currency fluctuations on the
competitiveness of Japanese exports, particularly in key sectors such as
electronic equipment, materials and autos, and thus corporate earnings. The
Bank of Japan has been easing monetary policy in an attempt to combat
deflation, weaken the yen and therefore render Japanese exports more
competitive. However, events elsewhere seem to have neutralised the effects of
that policy for the time being. A stronger yen may diminish investors'
confidence in the ability of Japanese companies to grow earnings in the near
term. However, we think the wider global economy, propelled to a large extent
by Asia, can continue to sustain a stable recovery regardless of the situation
in Europe and that bodes well for corporate Japan.

Despite gathering evidence of a near term peak in growth in the global
manufacturing cycle, there are a number of positive factors supporting a modest
uptrend in domestic demand. Against a backdrop of improving corporate earnings,
working hours are increasing and households are benefiting from a pickup in
wage and bonus payments. There are also encouraging signs that a positive spill
over from the production recovery is boosting sentiment in non-manufacturing
industries. Meanwhile, the government's new support measures are helping
families and the relaxation of visa restrictions for Chinese citizens should
provide a boost to the retail and services sectors. Although the effects of
policy stimulus implemented in the wake of the financial crisis will start to
fade, domestic demand should maintain a moderate upward trend.

Since the start of the year, Japanese stocks have outperformed their global
peers on a common currency basis. The firmer trend in foreign investors buying
Japanese stocks since the turn of the year suggests that some investors have
already begun to increase allocations to Japanese stocks. They have been drawn
to the attractive valuations, and an expected reversal in the headwinds holding
back the market: yen strength can be expected to wane given Prime Minister
Kan's support of a weaker currency, while the balance of equity supply and
demand is expected to improve from both sides now that capital raisings appear
to be largely complete.

CONTRACTS FOR DIFFERENCE

The portfolio manager has continued to use Contracts For Difference ("CFDs") to
increase the potential exposure to investments. As at the time of writing the
gross exposure was 123.6%. No "traditional" forms of gearing are currently
held.

SUBSCRIPTION SHARES

Further to the issue of subscription shares to ordinary shareholders in
November 2009, some subscription shareholders have exercised the rights
attached to those subscription shares in return for ordinary shares. A total of
86,865 ordinary shares have been allotted following these exercises at the end
of each month from February 2010.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

The Board believes that the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the
Company continue to fall into two broad categories. The first, external risks,
being stockmarket, share price and currency and the second, internal risks,
being investment management, governance/regulatory, financial and operational
administration. Information on each of these is given in the Business Review
section of the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2009.

Notes to the Financial Statements

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Half-Yearly financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the
accounting policies set out in the Company's annual report and financial
statements dated 31 December 2009.

As a result of technical guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales in TECH 01/08: "Distributable Profits",
changes in fair value of investments which are readily convertible to cash,
without accepting adverse terms at the balance sheet date, can be treated as
realised. As a result of the new SORP, capital reserves realised and unrealised
are shown in aggregate as capital reserve in the Reconciliation of Movements in
Shareholders' Funds and the Balance Sheet. At the balance sheet date all
investments held by the Company were listed on a recognised stock exchange and
were considered to be readily convertible to cash.

(Losses)/returns per ordinary share are based on the net revenue loss on
ordinary activities after taxation of £113,000 (31.12.09: £696,000; 30.06.09: £
209,000), the capital return in the period of £4,297,000 (31.12.09: return £
2,587,000; 30.06.09: loss £1,629,000) and the total return in the period of £
4,184,000 (31.12.09: return £1,891,000; 30.06.09: loss £1,838,000) and on
95,629,636 ordinary shares (31.12.09: 95,577,453; 30.06.09: 95,577,453), being
the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.

6 NET ASSET VALUE PER ORDINARY SHARE

The basic net asset value per ordinary share is based on net assets of £
57,336,000 (31.12.09: £53,104,000; 30.06.09: £49,375,000) and on 95,664,318
ordinary shares (31.12.09: 95,577,453; 30.06.09: 95,577,453), being the number
of ordinary shares in issue at the period.

The diluted net asset value per ordinary share has been calculated on the
assumption that the outstanding subscription shares of 19,028,516 at 30 June
2010 (31.12.09: 19,115,381; 30.06.09: nil) were exercised on that date. This
basis of calculation is in accordance with guidelines laid down by the
Association of Investment Companies and is provided to the London Stock
Exchange on an ongoing basis.

WARNING TO SHAREHOLDERS - BOILER ROOM SCAMS

Many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received
unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters. These
are typically from overseas based `brokers' who target UK shareholders,
offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares
in US or UK investments. These operations are commonly known as `boiler rooms'.
These `brokers' can be very persistent and extremely persuasive, and a 2006
survey by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) has reported that the average
amount lost by investors is around £20,000.

It is not just the novice investor that has been duped in this way; many of the
victims had been successfully investing for several years. Shareholders are
advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a
discount or offers of free company reports.

If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:

• Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation

• Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before getting involved by
visiting www.fsa.gov.uk/register

• Report the matter to the FSA either by calling 0845 606 1234 or visiting
www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk

• If the calls persist, hang up.

If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible to receive
payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The FSA can be
contacted by completing an online form at www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/regulated/
law/alerts/overseas.shtml

Details of any share dealing facilities that the Company endorses will be
included in company mailings.

More detailed information on this or similar activity can be found on the FSA
website www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk

The Fidelity Individual Savings Account ("ISA") is offered and managed by
Financial Administration Services Limited. The Fidelity Investment Trust Share
Plan is managed by FIL Investments International. Both companies are authorised
and regulated by the Financial Services Authority. The Fidelity Investment
Trust Share Plan is administered by BNP Paribas Securities Services and shares
will be held in the name of Puddle Dock Nominees Limited. The value of savings
and eligibility to invest in an ISA will depend on individual circumstances and
all tax rules may change in the future. Fidelity investment trusts are managed
by FIL Investments International. Fidelity only gives information about its own
products and services and does not provide investment advice based on
individual circumstances. Should you wish to seek advice, please contact a
Financial Adviser.

Please note that the value of investments and the income from them may fall as
well as rise and the investor may not get back the amount originally invested.
Past performance is not a guide to future returns. For funds that invest in
overseas markets, changes in currency exchange rates may affect the value of
your investment. Investing in small and emerging markets can be more volatile
than other more developed markets. Reference in this document to specific
securities should not be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell these
securities, but is included for the purposes of illustration only. Investees
should also note that the views expressed may no longer be current and may have
already been acted upon by Fidelity.
