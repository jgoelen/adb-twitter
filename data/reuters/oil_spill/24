TOKYO Aug 17 (Reuters) - The radar of a Japanese supertanker
that was damaged by an explosion near the Strait of Hormuz last
month showed a small ship making suspicious movements near it at
the time of the incident, Japanese public broadcaster NHK said on
Tuesday.

 Checks of the radar showed the suspicious ship left the area
at high speed immediately afterwards, NHK said. The explosion,
shortly after midnight on July 28, injured one seaman but caused
no oil spill or disruption to shipping in the strategic waterway. NHK said Japan's Transport Ministry believes there is a
possibility the small ship launched an attack. A militant group called Abdullah Azzam Brigades, linked to al
Qaeda, claimed on Aug. 4 that a suicide bomber belonging to it
had attacked the tanker. Security analysts were sceptical of the group's claim, though
the United Arab Emirates state news agency said investigators had
found traces of explosives on the tanker. The 333-metre-long very large crude carrier, named M.Star and
operated by Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, sustained damage to its hull but
was able to resume its voyage to Japan after repairs at a nearby
port. A Transport Ministry official in Tokyo said it was checking
the report, while Mitsui O.S.K. declined to comment. Industry sources said the tanker was carrying more than 2
million barrels of Qatar Land and Abu Dhabi Lower Zakum crudes,
equivalent to about half of Japan's daily oil needs.
