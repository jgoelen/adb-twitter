				/PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Save the Earth has organized a very unique fundraiser, which is scheduled to start in the middle of August at the famous Monterey Bay, located on California's Central Pacific Ocean Coast. Monterey Bay, with its pristine world-renowned and bio-diverse waters, was chosen as the fundraiser's kick-off point. The National Marine Sanctuary Program manages these waters along with the help from many concerned and active local residents, who have exhibited deep and strong Emotions for the Oceans.  This purpose is to raise awareness and money for the under-funded Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, which is the keynote/gold standard of Marine Research in the National Marines Sanctuaries Program. It is also the largest Marine Sanctuary in the United States, and reaches 275 miles from the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary near San Francisco to Cambria in the south. It extends from the high tide line to an average of 30 miles offshore, covering 6,094 square miles of water off central California.  The sanctuary is home to 26 threatened or endangered species, as well as 226 recorded shipwrecks.  This fundraiser event will be accomplished by selling SAVE THE EARTH/ EMOTIONS FOR THE OCEANS "T" Shirts in retail outlets located in the Monterey Bay area from Carmel to Santa Cruz, which is an area visited by a majority of coastal tourists, as well as the location of the largest gathering of Marine Research Facilities in the world.  Soon after its initial phase, the program will be expanded up to the San Francisco area as well as south along California's Coast. Sales are expected in every beach town down to San Diego.  If the media joins in and gets behind us, this fundraiser could develop into a National campaign to raise money for the entire National Marine Sanctuary Program.  Some of the proceeds will be sent to the Gulf of Mexico to assist in oil spill restoration.Save the Earth will be donating all of its profits from the much awaited EMOTIONS FOR THE OCEANS "T" Shirts to the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. This SAVE THE EARTH/EMOTIONS FOR THE OCEANS fundraiser will not only help the environment through Marine Research &amp; Restoration, via the Marine Sanctuary Program … It will also provide employment to persons with development disabilities via DesertArc of Palm Desert, CA which is the company SAVE THE EARTH has hired to print, package and ship the shirts.  … A win-win situation.
