Fitzpatrick. "Elections this year at every level are critical ones for mental health. Strong, non-partisan dialogue is urgent."State budget crises across the country have led to massive cuts in mental health services that have put lives at risk.

This is no time to cut mental health."The NAMI Election 2010s website includes federal and states action agendas and questions to ask candidates in public forums.
