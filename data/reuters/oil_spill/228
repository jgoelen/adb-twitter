WASHINGTON Aug 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Monday that it has completed negotiations on the $20 billion escrow fund for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and that BP Plc BP.&lt;L (BP.N) has made an initial contribution. &quot;We have made clear that the company still needs to ensure that the necessary funds will be available if something happens to the subsidiary that established the trust and we look forward to completion of an appropriate security arrangement in the near future,&quot; Associate Attorney General Tom Perrelli said. He said the initial contribution represented &quot;an important step&quot; toward honoring BP's commitment to President Barack Obama and to the residents and business owners in the Gulf region affected by the oil spill.
