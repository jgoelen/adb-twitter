   * Wins call for bids in Canada's Beaufort Sea

 (Adds company comment, background. In U.S. dollars unless
noted) CALGARY, Alberta, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N)
has acquired an exploration license for the Beaufort Sea in
Canada's Far North with a C$103.3 million ($101 million) bid as
the country gets set to review offshore drilling following the
BP (BP.L) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, which is responsible
for oil and gas activity in the Arctic, awarded Chevron a
205,946 hectare (508,800 acre) block north of the Yukon coast
and just east of the Canada-U.S. boundary. The acreage was up for grabs as part of a 2009-10 call for
bids and follows Chevron's last winning Beaufort acreage bid, a
C$1 million package in 2007. The company has yet to devise seismic and drilling plans
for the new block, Chevron Canada Vice-President David MacInnis
said. The plans will require approval by Canada's National
Energy Board. Chevron already had interests in 10 Beaufort discoveries,
including 33 percent of the 1986 Amauligak find and 13 percent
of the adjacent Issungak discovery. Its latest acquisition comes after a nearly C$600 million
acquisition of Beaufort Sea exploration rights in 2007 by
Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO.TO) and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and a
C$1.2 billion winning bid for acreage by BP Plc (BP.L) the
following year. Last month, the three formed a joint venture to explore on
their parcels to avoid duplication of equipment and personnel
in the remote, icy region. MacInnis said Chevron was not part of that tie-up, but was
open to looking for opportunities to work with other players in
the industry. Imperial said last week that the partners will not start
exploratory work until after the NEB completes its review of
offshore safety and environmental impact. The regulator
announced the review in response to heightened government and
public concern after the U.S. Gulf spill. Chevron will participate in the proceedings, MacInnis
said. "We're looking forward to the review and putting forward
some ideas as to how to improve performance and especially
address questions that are coming up on oil spill prevention
and containment," he said. When the NEB announced the review in May, it canceled a
planned hearing on a request from BP and Exxon to reexamine a
requirement that Arctic drillers need to drill a relief well in
the same season that an exploratory well is completed. There is no date yet for when the review is to begin. Chevron is operating Canada's only current offshore
drilling project, the deep water Lona 0-55 well in the Orphan
Basin off the coast of Newfoundland. It is expected to reach
its target depth next month. Chevron shares were down $1.04, or 1.3 percent, at $78.03
on the New York Stock Exchange. ($1=$1.02 Canadian)
