 * July payrolls data expected at 8:30 a.m. * AIG's shares rise 5 pct after quarterly results * Futures up: S&amp;P 1.9 pts, Dow 14 pts, Nasdaq 4.25 * For up-to-the-minute market news see [STXNEWS/US](Rewrites, adds details, quote, byline) By Leah Schnurr NEW YORK, Aug 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures edged
higher on Friday as investors awaited a key report on the labor
market to provide direction. High unemployment remains a big hurdle to a sustainable
recovery, and investors are anxious to see improvement.
Conflicting reports through the week have caused sentiment to
seesaw, with data showing private employers added more jobs
than expected last month, but initial claims for jobless
benefits unexpectedly rose last week. Economists polled by Reuters expected the U.S. Labor
Department report, due at 8:30 a.m. (12:30 GMT) to show a drop
of 65,000 in non-farm payrolls in July as temporary U.S. Census
Bureau jobs evaporated. Private employers are expected to have
added 90,000 jobs. For a preview, see [ID:nN05598486] "For a U.S. market that has really been struggling to
produce macro data that convinces investors that there's more
upside, this a very critically important macro data point
today," said Craig Peckham, equity trading strategist at
Jefferies &amp; Co in New York. "I think it will go a long way to either sustaining some of
the positive momentum conveyed during U.S. earnings season or
forcing some second-guessing if it comes as a disappointment." S&amp;P 500 futures SPc1 rose 1.9 points and were above fair
value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 added 14
points, and Nasdaq 100 futures NDc1 were up 4.25 points. Stocks have been consolidating for most of the week after
rising 10 percent since early July. But if Friday's employment
data pushes the S&amp;P 500 to close above its June high, charts
show there's little to keep the benchmark from extending the
summer rally. [ID:nN05162422] The S&amp;P has been closing in on its intraday June high of
about 1,131, which would open the door for a strong gain as
charts show little overhead resistance. U.S.-listed shares of BP Plc (BP.L)(BP.N) added 1.7 percent
to $41.25 in premarket trading. BP finished pumping cement into
its ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday to seal
off the source of the world's worst offshore spill, paving the
way to permanently plug the blow-out later this month.
[ID:nLDE6740LH] Shares of U.S. grain companies and others in the
agriculture sector could be in focus after Russia halted grain
exports as the country grapples with its most severe drought on
record. Grain company Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N) was up
1.1 percent at $30.58 in light volume. [ID:nSGE675064] Kraft Foods Inc (KFT.N) reported higher-than-expected
quarterly profit and raised its target for cost savings from
the acquisition of Cadbury. Its shares trading in Frankfurt
(KFT.F) were up 2 percent. [ID:nN05176007] American International Group Inc's (AIG.N) shares rose 3.4
percent to $41.34 after the company reported a quarterly loss,
primarily caused by a $3.3 goodwill impairment charge.
[ID:nN06184469] AIG is nearly 80 percent-owned by the U.S.
government. Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) shed 7.2 percent to $10.90
after it forecast its current-quarter profit and revenue to
come in below Wall Street's targets. [ID:nN04105733] Stocks edged lower Thursday as an unexpected rise in
initial jobless claims and unimpressive July retail sales
bruised sentiment.
