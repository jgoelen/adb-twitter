   * Oil spill clean-up contributes 3 pct points

 * Hot July weather contributes 1 pct point * Sees less benefit from clean-up in near term Aug 11 (Reuters) - WW Grainger Inc's (GWW.N) daily sales
for July saw a jump of 21 percent, as the industrial
distributor benefitted from the sale of safety-related items
for the oil spill clean-up in the Gulf of Mexico and hot
weather in the United States. Excluding the contribution from acquisitions and foreign
exchange, WW Grainger's daily sales rose 15 percent. WW Grainger, which offers products such as oil booms,
degreasers and safety supplies among other things, said sales
related to the oil spill clean-up are expected to contribute to
sales growth for the near term, but at a reduced rate than it
experienced in July. Millions of gallons of oil has poured into the Gulf of
Mexico since an April 20 blast on the Deepwater Horizon rig
triggered a huge spill, soiling 160 kilometer of coastline.
[ID:nN07190153] "There was an increase in sales related to the oil spill
clean-up in the Gulf of Mexico, particularly safety-related
items such as boots, goggles and protective outerwear," the
company said. The products sale related to the oil spill clean-up
contributed 3 percentage points. Seasonal related product sale
contributed 1 percentage point, which was helped by the hot
temperature in the United States in July. Shares of the company closed at $113.38 Tuesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
