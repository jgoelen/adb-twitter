  (Adds detail)LONDON Aug 13 (Reuters) - Oil and gas explorer
Mediterranean Oil and Gas (MOG.L) (MOG) said on Friday it was
still unclear whether offshore drilling restrictions in Italy
would prevent it from developing its main asset. The company said it will ask the Italian authorities for
clarification of the decree, which prohibits oil exploration and
production within five miles of the Italian coast and comes into
force on August 26, in relation to its Ombrina Mare field.
[ID:nLDE6601U7] MOG shares have lost over a quarter of their market value
since the day before the proposed ban became widely known on
July 1 as its Ombrina Mare oil and gas field is located less
than five miles offshore. Italy's environment ministry brought in the ban in June in
reaction to the oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico but the
move was criticised by energy analysts who said it showed a poor
understanding of the country's oil sector. [ID:nLDE66104C] The next step of the development of Ombrina Mare will be
started, said MOG, and should the decree affect it, the company
will consider possible action to challenge the Italian ruling.  The company warned that obtaining a production concession
for the oil field, a key step in enabling the development to go
forward would take longer than it previously thought. Shares in MOG closed at 24 pence on Thursday, valuing the
company at 9.4 million pounds ($14.6 million). (Reporting by Sarah Young; Editing by Matt Scuffham) ($1=.6413 Pound)
