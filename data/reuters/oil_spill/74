   * BP spill prompts limiting of environmental waiver process

* Deepwater drilling to require full environmental review* Interior will complete new environmental analysis of Gulf* Additional reviews could delay drilling projects-API(Adds comment from shallow water driller)By Ayesha RascoeWASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Interior Department
said on Monday it would limit the controversial practice of
allowing environmental waivers for deepwater drilling projects
and instead subject all such drilling to detailed analysis as
it evaluates its review process.Allowing companies to skip the environmental review process
for specific drilling projects has come under intense scrutiny
because BP (BP.L) (BP.N) was granted waivers for its
exploratory well that blew out of control in April. BP's doomed project that sent millions of gallons of oil
spewing into the Gulf was granted a waiver, or categorical
exclusion, from a full environmental analysis normally required
under the National Environmental Policy Act.The department also said it intends to complete a new review
of the Gulf of Mexico region to help guide future leasing and
development decisions.The American Petroleum Institute, the main U.S. oil lobby,
warned the restrictions would add unnecessary delays to
developing new energy projects."We're concerned the change could add significantly to the
department's workload, stretching the timeline for approval of
important energy development projects with no clear return in
environmental protection," API Upstream Director Erik Milito
said in a statement.The move provided some clarity about the approval process
for shallow water drillers hoping to get new permits for
drilling, however. Shallow water drillers have been pushing for
the department to speed up its permit approval process since
its drilling ban was lifted in waters less than 500 feet."We're encouraged," said Jim Noe, senior vice president at
Hercules Offshore Inc (HERO.O). "The announcement today
releases one question mark, but this isn't the only reason for
delay in issuing permits."Interior's decision comes as the White House's Council on
Environmental Quality released a report criticizing the
Interior department for a lack on transparency. It said the
department's review process "has led to confusion and concern
about whether environmental impacts were sufficiently evaluated
and disclosed."It also called on Interior to reassess the use of waivers
"in light of the increasing levels of complexity and risk"
associated with deepwater drilling.The categorical exclusion process was created to lessen the
paperwork and speed up developments deemed not to have a
significant impact on the environment.Kieran Suckling, director of the Center for Biological
Diversity, said the department's restriction of environmental
waivers does not go far enough."Categorical exclusion is meant for very minor projects like
building fences," Suckling said. "It's completely inappropriate
to use categorical exclusions for any kind of major drilling
operation, whether deepwater or shallow water."
