			DESTIN and FORT WALTON BEACH, Fla., Aug. 11 /PRNewswire/ -- Florida's Emerald Coast – encompassing Destin, Fort Walton Beach and Okaloosa Island – invites families to celebrate the recent capping of the Deepwater Horizon oil leak and savor the end of summer along Northwest Florida's 24 miles of sugar-white sands and emerald-green waters. From building sandcastles on the shore and watching dolphins at Florida's Gulfarium, to casting lines in the World's Luckiest Fishing Village and teeing off at more than 1,080 holes of golf, "The Moments You Live for, Still Live Here at Florida's Emerald Coast" (www.destin-fwb.com). Named the "No. 1 Beach Town in the South" for 14 consecutive years by the readers of Southern Living, Florida's Emerald Coast remains unpretentious and breathtakingly beautiful. As the nation rallies around the Gulf Coast communities affected by the oil spill, vacationers are encouraged to continue to support the beaches and stimulate the businesses of area hoteliers, restaurants and attractions."Seeing is believing around here and we invite families to see for themselves that what we're best known for is still the best around," says Emerald Coast Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau President and CEO Mark Bellinger.
