Files First Lawsuit in Connection with the Deepwater Horizon Incident
WATERSOUND, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
The St. Joe Company (NYSE:JOE) today announced a Net Loss for the second quarter
ended June 30, 2010 of $(8.6) million, or $(0.09) per share, including a pre-tax
restructuring charge of $1.2 million or $0.01 per share after tax. This compares
to a Net Loss in the second quarter of 2009 of $(44.8) million, or $(0.49) per
share, which included pre-tax non-cash charges of $64.7 million or $0.43 per
share after tax. 

Net Loss for the first half of 2010 was $(20.0) million, or $(0.22) per share.
This compares to a Net Loss during the same period of 2009 of $(56.9) million,
or $(0.62) per share, which included pre-tax non-cash charges of $66.2 million
or $0.44 per share after tax. 

Deepwater Horizon Incident

The Company is assessing the financial impact from the Deepwater Horizon
incident in the Gulf of Mexico on its current and future business operations and
prospects, and has retained legal counsel to direct the review and analysis of
the various legal claims and remedies available to the Company. On August 4,
2010, St. Joe filed its first lawsuit seeking the recovery of damages in
connection with the Deepwater Horizon incident. The assessment process and any
resulting litigation are expected to continue for an extended period of time. 

"In spite of the oil spill, we continue to focus on the long-term value of our
land holdings," said St. Joe's President and CEO, Britt Greene. "Prior to the
oil spill, we had seen momentum building in our operations; however, the oil
spill has adversely impacted our markets and has created uncertainty about the
future of the Gulf Coast region." 

Segment Results

During the second quarter in its residential business, St. Joe accepted
contracts on 20 homesites throughout its communities at an average price of
$135,400. The Company also closed on 11 homesites at an average price of
$109,000 in the resort communities of WaterColor and WaterSound West Beach in
Walton County and five homesites at an average price of $56,700 in the primary
community of Hawks Landing in Bay County. 



As part of the Company`s commercial focus, St. Joe launched VentureCrossings
Enterprise Centre at West Bay during the second quarter. VentureCrossings
encompasses the first 1,000 acres to be developed by St. Joe within the West Bay
Sector Plan adjacent to the Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport. It
includes 100 acres designated for retail, office and hotel uses, approximately
300 acres for light industrial uses, and approximately 600 acres for
manufacturing, distribution and logistics uses. 

Within VentureCrossings, site development has begun and construction is
scheduled to begin this year on a Class-A office building that St. Joe will
occupy as part of its previously announced corporate headquarters relocation. 

The Company will also break ground this year on a light industrial building
within VentureCrossings and has plans to develop an initial 300-space long-term
covered parking facility at the entrance to the airport. The covered parking
facility is expected to be operational by the spring of next year. 

As the Company remains focused on selling smaller tracts rather than larger,
contiguous acreage, St. Joe had limited rural land sales during the second
quarter and generated $0.4 million from the sale of 42 acres at an average price
of $9,482 per acre. The Company also generated $0.4 million from an easement
transaction during the second quarter and recognized $0.4 million from
previously deferred sales. 

Forestry revenues during the second quarter were $7.8 million, an increase of
$0.6 million from the second quarter of 2009, primarily due to the increased
sales price per ton on sawtimber. 

Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport

"The successful opening of the new airport has made the region more easily
accessible to the rest of the country and the global marketplace," said Greene.
"Although we remain concerned about the impact of the oil spill, we continue to
believe the airport has the potential to greatly accelerate the positive
transformation that is occurring in Northwest Florida and contribute to the
economic prosperity the region will realize over the coming decades." 

St. Joe and Southwest Airlines have entered into a strategic alliance agreement
providing for low-fare air service to the new airport. As part of the three-year
agreement which commenced on May 23, 2010, the Company has agreed to reimburse
Southwest Airlines if it incurs losses on its service at the new airport. During
the second quarter there was no required reimbursement payment to Southwest
Airlines. 

Balance Sheet

At June 30, 2010, St. Joe had cash of $138.9 million, pledged treasury
securities of $26.2 million and debt of $38.9 million, $26.2 million of which is
defeased debt. The Company's $125 million revolving credit facility remained
undrawn at June 30, 2010. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, St. Joe received
a $67.7 million tax refund from the United States Department of the Treasury. 



"With our nearly debt-free balance sheet, efficient cost structure and more than
300,000 acres of land within 40 miles of the new airport, we have positioned the
Company to take advantage of the increased economic activity that we expect to
realize as a result of the opening of the new airport," said William S.
McCalmont, St. Joe`s Executive Vice President and CFO. 

Capital expenditures for the first six months of 2010 were $6.0 million,
compared to $9.4 million for the same period in 2009, a reduction of 36 percent.
In addition, St. Joe incurred cash overhead costs of $11.9 million during the
quarter, compared to $14.4 million for the second quarter last year, a 17
percent reduction. 

Land Holdings and Land Use Entitlements

On June 30, 2010, St. Joe owned approximately 577,000 acres, concentrated
primarily in Northwest Florida. Approximately 404,000 acres, or 70 percent of
the Company's total land holdings, are within 15 miles of the coast of the Gulf
of Mexico. 

On June 30, 2010, St. Joe's land-use entitlements in hand or in process totaled
approximately 31,600 residential units and approximately 11.6 million square
feet of commercial space, as well as an additional 646 acres with land-use
entitlements for commercial uses.

Cash overhead is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe this information is
useful to investors in understanding the underlying operational performance of
the Company, its business and performance trends. Specifically, we believe that
the reduction in total cash overhead shows investors the cash savings achieved
by management through various restructuring initiatives. Although we believe
disclosure of total cash overhead enhances investors` understanding of our
business and performance, this non-GAAP financial measure should not be
considered an alternative to GAAP basis financial measures.
