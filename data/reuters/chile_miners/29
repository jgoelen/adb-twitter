SANTIAGO Aug 22 (Reuters) - Rescue workers have detected
signs that some of 33 Chilean miners trapped down a shaft more
than two weeks ago are alive, state television said on Sunday,
but the government said there was no official confirmation.

 Local radio said a drill that had perforated deep into the
mine near where the miners had been trapped had been pulled out
with paint on it.
