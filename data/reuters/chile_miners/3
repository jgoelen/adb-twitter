LIMA (Reuters) - A spate of recent mine accidents in Latin America has renewed calls for better enforcement of existing safety rules and is putting more focus on wildcat miners in a sector dominated by big global companies.

The cave in of a mine in Chile where 33 miners have been trapped for 19 days and the collapse of a tunnel at a wildcat gold mine in Venezuela on Tuesday have exposed the dangers of working in small mines, far removed from the sophisticated world of large modern mines, a safety expert said.While overstretched regulators are mainly focused on sprawling mines that cost billions of dollars to build, attractive commodities prices -- especially for gold -- have lured thousands of fortune seekers into the risky business of wildcat mining."The regulations in the region are basically sound, what's necessary is more enforcement because whenever you go into a mine underground you are taking a risk with your life," said Luis Castillo, the head of Peru's federation of mine workers."Governments must pay more attention to the sector because it generates lots of tax revenues."The growth of small-scale mines, which are often unlicensed and can be opened up in a matter of days, has increased the likelihood for accidents as wildcatters have little training and often rely on rudimentary tools and dynamite to mine, said Jorge Pontt of Chile's Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria."In general, the big companies meet international standards, with skilled labor, modern machines and relatively good safety records," Pontt said."But with the small mines there is a huge gap, so it's with the small ones where safety standards are very low," said Pontt, who is an expert on mine safety issues for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.Compania Minera San Esteban Primera, which owns the San Jose mine that collapsed in Chile, has said its mine was safe.Chile's President Sebastian Pinera recently fired the country's top mining regulators following the mine collapse to demand accountability.Venezuela's government has sent the army out repeatedly this year to try to curb wildcat gold mining.Pontt says the only way to improve safety at small mines -- many of which are marginal producers that can only turn a profit when prices are high -- is to introduce more automation, mechanization and remote-control machines.Mexico's mining unions have said the government tolerates unsafe conditions at mines and does little to ensure that workers' complaints are listened to. The Mexican government has denied the allegations.Chile, Peru and Mexico are leading exporters of base or precious metals, while Venezuela and Colombia are increasingly grabbing the attention of upstart mining companies and Brazil is a top producer of iron ore.Large mines built recently in each of the Latin American countries are about as safe as those in the United States, says Pontt.Latin America appears to be a safer place to mine than in China."Labor policies are much better here than in China," said Castillo, the union leader.The number of people killed in Chinese coal mines dropped to 2,631 in 2009, an average of seven a day, from 3,215 in 2008, according to Chinese government statistics cited in April.China has ordered the consolidation or takeover of many private mines to help reduce accidents.(Additional reporting by Molly Rosbach in Santiago and Robert Campbell in Mexico City; editing by Carol Bishopric)
