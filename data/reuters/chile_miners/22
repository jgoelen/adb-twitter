SANTIAGO Aug 22 (Reuters) - Thirty-three miners trapped
underground for more than two weeks after a cave-in have been
located and tied a message to a drill saying they are all
alive, a member of the rescue mission told state television on
Sunday.

 "There was a note that said there are 33 workers alive down
here," said the resuce worker, who was not identified.
