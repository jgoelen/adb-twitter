 Aug 22 (Reuters) - Hopes of finding 33 miners alive more
than two weeks after they were trapped in a mine revived on
Sunday after rescuers said they believed they had heard
knocking on a drill.

 Major mining accidents are rare in Chile, but the San Jose
mine cave-in shed light on lax controls over smaller operations
that lure thousands to work for a steady pay check in the
mineral-rich Atacama desert.

 A PricewaterhouseCoopers study in 2003 reported that fatal
injuries in Chile's mining industry were less common than in
the U.S. and Canada.

 Still, Chile has had its share of major mine accidents:

 * 2006 - Two trucks exploded at a mine entrance near
Copiapo killing two miners and temporarily trapping 70 others
inside the mine.

 * 1994 - An explosion at a Schwager coal mine near Coronel
killed 21 miners trapped 900 meters below.

 * 1989 - A dynamite charge flooded a shaft at the Los
Castanos coal mine, drowning more than 20 miners.

 * 1965 - More than 200 people died when a tailings dam at
the El Cobre mine collapsed in an earthquake.
