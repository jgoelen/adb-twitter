 * Miners trapped underground for over a fortnight * Could be in mine shaft shelter equipped with oxygen SANTIAGO, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Hopes of finding 33 miners alive more than two weeks after they were trapped in a mine revived on Sunday after rescuers said they believed they had heard knocking on a drill. Rescue workers said a small-bore drill had reached nearly 700 meters underground and had perforated a tunnel near to where the miners are believed to have sought refuge after the mine caved in on Aug. 5. There has been no contact with them since the collapse at a small gold and copper mine near the northern city of Copiapo. &quot;Obviously, there is a degree of happiness,&quot; a beaming Mining Minister Laurence Golborne told state television from the mine entrance, where relatives of the trapped men have been camped out for over a fortnight. He added, however: &quot;There is nothing concrete ... We are talking about tubes 700 meters long, so the knocks could be falling stones.&quot; &quot;Spirits are up,&quot; one rescue worker told state television. &quot;Some of our companions said they heard them hit the drill and they answered. That was all the communication there was.&quot;&lt;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ FACTBOX-Major Chile mine accidents      [ID:nN06266599] For a graphic, see link.reuters.com/baj73n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&gt; The miners are 4.5 miles (7 km) inside the winding mine and about 700 meters vertically underground. Authorities hope the miners took refuge in a shelter equipped with oxygen and are rationing their food and water. Rescue workers say it could take 120 days to dig a new tunnel to reach the miners after the main mine ramp collapsed. The government said earlier this month that the likelihood of finding the miners alive was low. President Sebastian Pinera has sacked top officials of Chile's mining regulator and vowed a major overhaul of the agency in light of the accident. Serious mining accidents are rare in Chile, but the government says the San Jose mine, owned by local private company Compania Minera San Esteban Primera, has suffered a series of mishaps and 16 workers were killed in recent years.
