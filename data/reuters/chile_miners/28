Aug 22 (Reuters) - Thirty-three Chilean miners trapped deep
underground sent a message to the surface tied to a drill  on
Sunday, saying they were all alive, in their first contact
since a cave-in 17 days ago, but experts said it would take
months to dig them out. The following are some facts about Chile: * In February, a massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake and
ensuing tsunamis hammered south-central Chile, killing more
than 500 people, hammering industries and causing an estimated
$30 billion hit to the economy. It was one of the world's
biggest quakes on record. * In 1960, Chile was hit by the world's biggest earthquake
according to records dating to 1900, U.S. Geological Survey
data shows. The 9.5-magnitude quake devastated the
south-central coastal city of Valdivia, killing 1,655 people
and sending a tsunami that battered Easter Island, 2,300 miles
(3,700 km) off Chile's Pacific seaboard. It continued as far as
Hawaii, Japan and the Philippines. * Chile's chain of about 2,000 volcanoes is the world's
second-largest after Indonesia, and is part of the Pacific
"Ring of Fire" of seismic activity. Some 50 to 60 are on record
as having erupted, and 500 are potentially active. The Chaiten
volcano, 760 miles (1,200 km) south of Santiago in the
Patagonia region, erupted in May 2008 for the first time in
thousands of years, spewing a plume of ash visible from space. * Chile is one of the longest countries in the world,
stretching around 2,700 miles (4,300 km) from its northern
desert border with Peru and Bolivia to South America's southern
tip by Cape Horn, once a major world shipping route. * Chile is the world's largest producer of copper, its main
export. It produces about 34 percent of world output of the red
metal, which is used in electronics, cars and refrigerators.
Most of the country's mines are in the North. * Augusto Pinochet ruled Chile with an iron fist for 17
years from a 1973 coup until 1990. The dictator died in 2006
without facing full trial on rights abuses during his rule,
when more than 3,000 people were killed or disappeared and an
estimated 28,000 people were tortured.
