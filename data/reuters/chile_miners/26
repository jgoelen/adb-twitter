SANTIAGO Aug 22 (Reuters) - Thirty-three Chilean miners
trapped underground for more than two weeks after a cave-in
sent a message to the surface on Sunday confirming they are all
alive. Given the mine is unstable, they face a months-long wait
underground as rescue workers dig new tunnels to extract them. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? Now that the miners are all confirmed alive, rescue workers
are racing to send them narrow plastic tubes called "doves"
containing glucose, hydration packets, mineral-enriched water
and other supplies. Workers made visual contact with the miners
via a television camera, which officials said showed they were
in better condition than they expected; the next step will be
to send down flashlights and communications equipment. Mining
Minister Laurence Golborne estimated that the "doves" would
reach the miners later on Sunday night. HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO RESCUE THEM? Due to the instability of the mine, rescue workers had to
abandon efforts to try to make their way past the main cave-in
as well as a bid to descend via a ventilation shaft after a
fresh collapse. Mining specialists from state-run copper giant Codelco
[CODEL.UL] have approved two possible rescue operations They will now drill a wider shaft with a bigger, more
powerful perforation drill 2,300 feet (700 metres) straight
down, which would take an estimated 3 to 4 months to complete. An alternative plan is to dig a new spiral tunnel of around
2 to 3 miles (3.5 to 5 km) in length to reach them, which could
take up to a year. WHAT WILL BE THE INDUSTRY FALLOUT? The halt in operations at the small copper and gold mine
will barely affect copper output in Chile, the world's No. 1
copper producer. Lasting effects of the cave-in will be felt
throughout the industry, however, as the government has pledged
a massive overhaul of mining regulator Sernageomin, which
allowed the mine to reopen despite grave safety concerns. Pinera has already sacked the heads of Sernageomin, and
government officials are now calling for the owners of the mine
to take responsibility for their part in the accident. Serious mining accidents are rare in Chile, but the
government says the San Jose mine, owned by local private
company Compania Minera San Esteban Primera, has suffered a
series of mishaps and 16 workers were killed in recent years.
