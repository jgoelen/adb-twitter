   * Cave-in hits informal miners in remote south

 * Latest in spate of South American accidents * Chavez government opposes illegal gold mining
 (Adds mining minister, details) By German Dam UPATA, Venezuela, Aug 24 (Reuters) - A collapsed tunnel at
a wildcat gold pit in south Venezuela has killed six people and
injured another two, authorities said, in South America's
latest mining accident this year. The accident occurred on Monday night in remote jungle near
the town of El Callao in the mineral-rich southeastern state of
Bolivar. Some miners in the area said others were trapped, but
authorities doubted anyone was still in the tunnels. A run of accidents at South American mines has increased
concerns over safety standards in an industry expanding quickly
in several countries in the region. An ongoing rescue operation in Chile, where 33 miners have
been trapped for 19 days in a mine, was preceded in June by a
blast at a Colombian coal mine that killed 70 people.
[ID:nN22135549] [ID:nN18118065] Miners' representatives put the Venezuelan death toll
higher than the official version of six. Alfredo Villanueva, spokesman for a local wildcat miners'
association, said 15 had died, while Nelly Matute, president of
a cooperative active at the mine, put the toll at 14. The pit, known as Tomi, is riddled with hand-built tunnels
where about 300 men work in small groups seeking underground
gold veins deep in the jungle. "They put their lives at risk," Venezuela's Mining Minister
Jose Khan told state television, confirming six men were killed
and another two injured in the accident. "We presume there are no other people dead or trapped in
the place," he added. Bolivar state's head of emergency services, Jose Garcia,
also said he did not believe more men were trapped. "It collapsed while the miners were digging a tunnel. There
is one man injured in hospital and another injured person who
left the hospital," Garcia told Reuters, adding that heavy
machinery was working at the site to look for more casualties. GOLD RUSH Wildcat miners are wary of authorities because their
makeshift pits are usually illegal. The Venezuelan army has
been sweeping Bolivar state this year to try and stamp out a
gold rush triggered by high prices for the yellow metal.
[ID:nN01257113] Gold XAU= hit a record high near $1,265 an ounce in June
as investors looked to precious metals for an alternative to
equity or debt investments given renewed uncertainty about the
economic recovery. Venezuela sits on some of the hemisphere's largest gold
deposits but its formal mining industry is small.
Russian-Canadian company Rusoro (RML.V), which operates in the
El Callao area, is the main private gold miner in Venezuela. Formal miners produce about 6 tonnes of gold each year,
according to official figures, with the army estimating that
wildcats produce twice that amount. The South American OPEC member nation has gold reserves of
more than 360 tonnes, the Central Bank says. (Additional reporting by Diego Ore, Marianna Parraga and
